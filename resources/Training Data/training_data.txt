987	We are planning a large change, and just curious to see how others might have tackled it.	0	126491
988	I wanted to keep an original "copy/backup" of our data up to 12/31/2015 and then roll over a new copy/database for 2016 and make the changes there.	0	126491
989	However, Xero doesn't work similarly to QB, where you can download a copy of the database and store.	0	126491
990	It was suggested to do a major upload of the new GL codes, however - that seems fraught with issues and potential overwriting, and less out of our control, if you are switching codes one by one.	1	126491

1006	Xero currently isn't recording the expense part of salary sacrifice transactions correctly.	1	133835
1007	At present the pre sacrifice amounts allocated to gross wages.	0	133835
1008	I would expect the sacrificed amount should be allocated to the appropriate expense.	0	133835
1009	For example where there is a gross wage of $1200 and $200 sacrificed for superannuation the gross wage of $1200 goes to wages expense and none of the sacrifice to superannuation expense.	0	133835
1010	This means each month/quarter/year manual journals are needed to correct the allocation.	0	133835
1011	This becomes more important with other types of salary sacrifice, such as motor vehicles where GST applies.	0	133835
1012	It would be good to add an expense account to pre tax deduction pay items that auto posts the debit to the appropriate expense and credit to the wages expense account.	0	133835
1013	Alternatively if we have the option for the account in the payroll item to be more than just a liability account as is presently the case.	0	133835
1014	This would at least allow the credit entry to be allocated against wages.	0	133835
1015	This would then shows correct gross wages and allow the salary sacrifice expense to be managed separately.	0	133835

1081	When trying to edit invoices and quotes, the "reference number" on the invoice/quote keeps coming up as the invoice number.	0	135470
1082	e.g. Invoice No. - INV-0019Reference should be - "customers name"but it comes up as INV-0019I went onto the .docx file but it shows the <<invoiceNumber>> where the invoice number is and <<reference>> where reference is.	1	135470

1084	This Xero  shows the process of entering receipts.	0	134177
1085	 It starts with the mobile app, and then moves to the browser and at 50 seconds says "just like the mobile app fill in the expense".	0	134177
1086	Except from what I can see, it's not just like the mobile app.	0	134177
1087	In the mobile app the user can assign expenses just as I'd expect any expense app to work, by assigning them to a category ("meals")  also to the account it was paid from, i.e. a company credit card or by the employee etc.	0	134177
1088	In the browser I see no way to select the account the expense was paid from, and therefore no way for the approver to know how the transaction was even paid for.	1	134177

1095	I have a new situation.	0	134767
1096	A contractor who I normally pay had an invoice owing to me (she pays a base rent when doesn't bring in any income).	0	134767
1097	She had not paid by the time her next "payment" from me was made so I deducted the "monies owing" (invoice amount) from the bill amount I paid her.	0	134767
1098	This means that I now have 2 items to deal with:1.  the original invoice she owed eg. $500 looks like its still owing2.  the payment I made to her looks like a part payment of a bill -ie I created the bill as usual for her consulting fees -then deducted what she owed me.	1	134767
1099	So bill $2000 -I paid her $1500.	0	134767

1128	Hi all,I'm in Canada, and my business is able to file GST using the "quick method".	0	125442
1129	In short, this method is designed to reduce administrative work for small businesses and allows them to pay GST calculated using an approximation of tax owed, based on sales, rather than based on the actual amount collected/paid.	0	125442
1130	So, for example, I have a sales tax account that says I owe the government $1,000 but the quick method means I only actually owe them $900.	0	125442

1138	Hi,We are a high volume store that processes over a hundred transactions per day.	0	128766
1139	The amount that are paid via EFTPOS show up in the bank as a single transaction (one for each EFTPOS machine).	0	128766
1140	Obviously, banked cash shows up as a single deposit.	0	128766
1141	The problem is, I want to be able to enter sales separated by department of the store, as our expenses are recorded.	1	128766
1142	The way we did this with Reckon was an EFT Clearing account, and an Undeposited Funds account, which we then entered a manual journal weekly that credited Sales accounts and debited these two clearing accounts.	0	128766
1143	When the money hit the bank, this was credited as coming from these clearing accounts.	0	128766
1144	I was wondering if there was a better way of doing this in Xero, as it is a lot of manual data entry every week for every store!	3	128766

1165	I converted my books from Quickbooks.	0	126708
1166	#1 - How is the statement balance calculated in Xero?	3	126708
1167	My Xero balance is spot on with my bank account, but the statement balance is some number that has never been a statement ending balance or a daily balance in my checking account.	1	126708
1168	I tried following the steps if the two balances don't match, but nothing has worked. 	0	126708
1169	I figure if I understand how it comes up with it I may be able to tweak some things.	0	126708
1170	#2 - Reconciliation seems to encompass much more than I'm used to.	0	126708
1171	To me a reconciliation is when you match all your entered transactions with an end of month statement to make sure you have entered everything correctly.	0	126708
1172	I don't see a way to do this in Xero.	1	126708
1173	Xero seems to only reconcile transactions with daily downloads from the bank.	1	126708
1174	Is there a way to reconcile with a bank statement as well?	3	126708

1194	Hi all,I would like to record all outbound payments within Xero.	0	125276
1195	I was hoping to record payments in Xero as and when we pay by bacs or card payment over the phone.	0	125276
1196	This works fine when we have been invoiced.	0	125276
1197	However, we are on proforma invoicing with some of our suppliers.	0	125276
1198	In these instances we tend to pay the proforma, await the invoice before processing into Xero.	0	125276
1199	We then spend too long allocating payments as there can be a time before the invoice ends up in Xero.	1	125276
1200	I envisaged some sort of merging proforma and invoice together but I don't really know what is the correct practice with managing these types of transactions.	0	125276
1201	Any help would be much appreciated.	4	125276
1202	Thanks,Richard	4	125276
1203	Bought 100 Widgets at $10 each on credit card 1, created a bill for $1,000Upon inspection, 10 widgets were damaged, and returned to the supplier.	0	125999
1204	They issued a refund to a different credit card.	0	125999
1205	Credit card 1 shows $1000 expense Credit card 2 shows -$100 ('income')I discovered a Bill couldn't be used for a negative value.	0	125999
1206	I understand that a credit note can be created, but since the inventory has been reduced already I think applying the credit note might not work?	3	125999
1207	Wondering if an invoice for the 10 widgets with a credit note is the answer?	3	125999
1208	Or just an invoice?	3	125999
1209	Or something else entirely?	3	125999
1210	Thanks in advance for any ideas.	4	125999
1211	Hello,Still getting to grips with Xero.	0	126919
1212	I am doing my my first pay run and the PAYE, Employee NIC and Employer NIC have correctly deducted from the final amount in 'Step 2. Enter Employee Payments' however, when clicking through to 'Step 3. Review' they are  as 'Other payments'.	1	126919
1213	I have tried changing options but have had no success yet.	0	126919

1222	He has some old, unmatched bank transactions from a previous year - so irrelevant - and wants them to just go away.	0	125316

1226	I've chosen my conversion date to be 1/1/13 so I can start the new year off correctly.	0	136557
1227	Now I'm confused because I'm setting up my bank feed and I'm being asked to choose which transactions to import - all available or starting on a certain date.	1	136557

1233	HiLooking for recommendations for a POS system that sends sales to Xero from my clients cash register in his shop.	0	138841
1234	My client sells pet foods so has different tax rates and needs to identify these for VAT purposes.	0	138841
1235	Currently my client has a POS system that scans the barcode of the goods and feeds these direct to sage.	0	138841
1236	Ideal is to have something very similar to this so as not to disrupt their business unnecessarily	0	138841
1237	Working in both the UK and Ireland we have staff i both locations.	0	133559
1238	The full payroll features for the UK should be extended to included using Xero within Ireland.	1	133559
1239	We have a client who sends a fixed price purchase order which is then used for a quarter.	0	126417
1240	Is there a way to track how much of a client's PO has been billed through Xero?	3	126417

1242	I have a private loan, registered under 900 � Loan in the chart of accounts.	0	126047
1243	There's no interest on the loan.	0	126047
1244	Question 1Company capital from loan	0	126047
1245	One part of this loan is to pay a third-party to set up the company.	0	126047
1246	The other part (let's say 50% to keep it simple) is capital to be put into the company.	0	126047

1252	Hi community,I'm new to Xero (and very much new to accounting as well, oh the joys).	0	136009
1253	I have setup my PayPal feed and it has imported all the transaction lines correctly.	0	136009
1254	However the transaction lines pull in the gross value which excludes the paypal fees.	1	136009
1255	How do i show that i have had a fee on certain transactions in Xero?	3	136009
1256	What i done on my previous system was every month tally up the paypal fees and add an entry of that value.	0	136009
1257	What is recommended?	3	136009
1258	Hi everyoneI appreciate that this basic question might be beyond the scope of the forum, but I'm trying to inform HMRC of the fact that this is the end of year PAYE submission.	0	125493
1259	There's a KB article on the Xero site which in turn sends me to a YouTube video from the HMRC about ticking a box on a page in the HMRC portal to tell them that the most recent submission was the last of the year, but I can't see that anywhere.	1	125493
1260	Given that the video is a bit old, am I to assume that Xero will inform HMRC that this PAYE submission is the last of the year?	3	125493
1261	I'm confused as to how that last piece of the puzzle works.	0	125493
1262	I've done my PAYE reconciling and worked through the list of check points in the Xero article.	0	125493
1263	There's only me on the payroll so I can't imagine that anything can go too wrong.	0	125493
1264	ThanksOlly	4	125493
1265	Good morning,I wanted to give some feedback on one of the connected apps Veeqo.	0	138890
1266	This is an inventory management company and having investigated all of the apps this one came out the best for price and features.	0	138890
1267	Unfortunately Veeqo is massively let down by the lack of customer service and knowledge that the staff have.	1	138890
1268	We have had many issues since we started to use Veeqo and these have been addressed by the staff.	0	138890
1269	However, it is incredibly time consuming to get a response, impossible to speak to someone by phone, and became evident that although we went through several induction sessions to discuss the workings of our business Veeqo had not understood our requirements.	0	138890
1270	The planned meetings we had with various members of staff were regularly late commencing and on occasion did not happen at all.	1	138890
1271	The response to this was "These thing happen in business"Finally when I tried to submit a complaint it proved impossible to speak to a manger and after over a week of constant e-mails from us we finally receive a response that accepts no responsibility and no solution.	0	138890
1272	I have worked with many Xero connected apps and as a rule they have all been successful, the companies have been helpful and staff incredibly knowledgeable and forthcoming.	0	138890
1273	Most importantly I have always been able to get hold of someone if there have been any issues.	0	138890
1274	We have now moved to a new Inventory control system (slightly more expensive) and have already seen a massive improvement in service.	0	138890
1275	I am positive as with most things people have had positive experiences with Veeqo however I wanted to provide feedback for anyone else who is looking for an Inventory add on.	0	138890
1276	Thanks	4	138890
1277	Hello,As my employees do not know the business' nor my twelve month plan.	0	137507
1278	I prefer that a face to face discussion with myself takes place in the future in regards putting in for leave.	0	137507
1279	Once we have agreed and discussed all the pros and cons then I would like to enter it in to the Leave section.	0	137507
1280	At the moment It has given them to much control to discuss and organise their lives around each other without knowing any fundamentals of what is expected at those times of the business and without and consultation.	1	137507
1281	Way to much chit chat already about the Easter break.	1	137507
1282	After the fact puts me in an awkward situation, and it was never like that until these portals arrived.	0	137507
1283	I would like pop up options for admin that has a block effect in this case.	0	137507
1284	That says "Your employer ass per company policy will need to speak to you before holiday/Leave entry times are requested".	0	137507
1285	Thank you Fabian	4	137507
1286	In California - and perhaps other states - goods which are purchased for resale are exempt from Sales Tax on that purchase.	0	126360
1287	However some vendors charge tax at the time of sale because they aren't set up to handle resale customers.	0	126360
1288	In this case, the sales taxes paid on goods for resale may be used as an offset against sales tax liability (the forwarding of sales taxes collected on goods sold to the taxing authority).	0	126360
1289	How should I set up Xero so when I pay sales taxes on goods purchased for resale I can see those amounts on my sales tax report and properly deduct them from my sales tax liability?	3	126360
1290	We are considering using Xero as a replacement for our existing bespoke system.	0	128513
1291	The guidelines suggest Xero is suitable for 200-500 invoice per month.	0	128513

1293	Hi all, I have two basic questions that I was unable to locate in a search:	0	125471
1294	1.) When importing goods from overseas, I am reconciling the transaction at this point without GST.	0	125471
1295	Do I record this as 'No Tax' or 'Tax Exclusive'?	3	125471
1296	2.) I am paying the GST as the goods arrive into NZ customs thus there is a separate transaction for the GST alone.	0	125471
1297	How do I reconcile this?	3	125471
1298	Can I reconcile this as the 820 GST Liability?	3	125471
1299	Thanks in advance from a small business owner :)	4	125471
1300	How do I split or apportion depreciation expense over various teams using the Auto-Depreciate feature in the FAR?	3	127153

1302	Xero has not been prompting for any payroll tax because my s-corp has not paid any payroll this year (yet) to its employee (myself self employed).	0	128193
1303	I am in state of Virginia, USA.	0	128193
1304	Do I need to file a form, pay business state and federal income tax on a quarterly/monthly basis for what my corporation has been generating income every month?	3	128193
1305	Or will it be due annually when filed if owed?	3	128193
1306	A client of mine has been using the new discount feature on sales invoices which is a really handy feature, the problem is that the discount does not appear in the standard .docx template.	1	136590
1307	We have not modified this template in any way so I would have expected this to show up as a line item somewhere.	0	136590
1308	Discounts do show up on the regular (non .docx) branding theme.	0	136590
1309	Am I missing something or do Xero need to modify their .docx documents to present discounting?	3	136590
1310	Many thanksSean	4	136590
1311	I am trying to find a way to separate the invoices and packing slips, so that when I use "Print PDF" it prints both, but when I email I can just email the invoice and not the packing slip.	1	128792
1312	I am getting some confused customers wondering why they get a copy of the packing slip everytime I email the invoice.	0	128792
1313	Hi there,We have some staff paid monthly and one staff member in particular has a few leave requests throughout the month.	0	137363
1314	Each leave period shows as a separate line on his payslip.	0	137363
1315	The payslip looks messy with the multiple leave lines with nothing to differentiate them apart from the number of hours taken and even some of those figures are the same.	1	137363
1316	Is there a way to just make it show as one line or to get details of the leave dates added?	3	137363
1317	Thanks,Candice	4	137363
1318	Hello everyoneWe have done our payroll on Xero for the first time in April 2015.	0	137990
1319	We noticed that the Employment Allowance is not deducted from the PAYE due payable to HMRC automatically.	1	137990
1320	Xero noted that we need to make a journal entry to be able to claim this.	0	137990
1321	The relevant boxes have been ticked as required.	0	137990
1322	How do we do this and how do we know the exact amount to be deducted.	3	137990

1325	Hi,When renting our office we paid a security deposit.	0	127493
1326	How do i record that in Xero so that we get reminded at the end of the lease to collect it.	3	127493
1327	We would like to set up a control.	0	127493
1328	Best,	4	127493
1329	Hi there,We have just migrated over to Xero from Free Agent, and have noticed we have a tonne of sales invoices listed under our "awaiting payment" tab, that aren't marked as "sent".	0	135426
1330	However, when I go into the invoice detail it says "awaiting payment"	1	135426
1331	Can I therefore assume that these HAVE been sent (even though its' not marked as such) and that I don't need to resend these again?	3	135426
1332	FYI these mainly seem to relate to recurring invoices.	0	135426
1333	I've also checked under "history and notes" section, but it's not listed here either.	0	135426
1334	Any info gratefully received!	4	135426
1335	If employees do not have hours in this payrun should I delete the timesheet for them before I process the payrun?	3	137883
1336	If I leave them intact (I haven't input to them), the pay run generates a small payment for them due to tax refund.	1	137883
1337	In Sage, I would have set these to 'On Hold' this week.	0	137883
1339	Hi,Our Employees, like many other companies in Australia, can accrue a maximum of 76 hours personal leave, once they have reached the 76 we should be able to set a ceiling so it accrues no further.	0	136911
1340	Resetting to 0 annually doesn't work as an employee who hasn't taken any time off is still entitled to their 76 hours.	1	136911
1341	Example: Jim has been working for Company A for 14 months, he hasn't had any time off for personal/carers leave, he gets sick and needs 3 days off so his personal leave balance should reflect 53.2 hours and start accruing again at the weekly rate of 1.4615 until it again reaches 76 hours.	0	136911
1342	Without a ceiling the accrual is not reflective of actual entitlements and we need to manually go back through the last 12 months for an employee and see how many hours they have taken and subtract that from amount accrued in that period and add the balance accrued before that period.	1	136911
1343	Or we need to make a manual adjustment every week for employees who have reached the maximum.	1	136911
1344	It's all very messy and could be easily fixed with a settable ceiling.	0	136911
1345	Hi,My inventory items don't show in bills.	1	134413
1346	They show in invoices on the customer side and in the inventory list itself but they're not available for use in bills - there's nothing there at all.	1	134413
1347	Anyone got any ideas on this one please?	3	134413
1348	RegardsDave	4	134413
1349	HelloMy client just change from MYOB to XERO but I am a new XERO'S user, so I am a bit confuse about how to manage some accounts.	0	128373
1350	My client has 2 businesses and he pays bills from any of the businesses' accounts, so we are managing it as a inter-companies loans.	0	128373
1351	In MYOB we had set up a credit car account for the inter-companies loan.	0	128373
1352	When the company paid other's company bills, we did spend money from the bank account and increase the loan account balance.	0	128373
1353	When the other company's paid an expense of this company then we transfer the money to the credit card and decrease the balance.	0	128373
1354	When we received a payment in this account that was other company's service we did a receive money and decrease the balance.	0	128373
1355	We did something similar with ATO Integrated account.	0	128373
1356	We created a credit card account, then spend money when we need to enter the GST, PYG, interest etc and transfer money when the payments were done.	0	128373
1357	I was able to reconciled it with the ATO statements.	0	128373
1358	Could I work in the same way in XERO or it looks as a messy books if the  credit card accounts are not reconciled (in the Loan case)?	3	128373
1359	How best does one offset an equal debtor and creditor balance that is due to/from the same entity?	3	127746
1360	I want to sell a fixed asset to an entity at Net Book Value to a connected party.	0	127746
1361	Having followed the help section this will raise a sales invoice (@ nil profit) and raise a trade debtor.	0	127746
1362	That same party will also bill me separately a management fee for the same amount.	0	127746
1363	This means there will be no cash or VAT impact on either party.	0	127746
1364	However it does leave me with a Trade Creditor and a Trade Debtor of equal amounts.	1	127746
1365	How best do I offset these to keep my Xero accounts clean?	3	127746
1366	As background info - I'm winding down a company and want to clear out the balance sheet.	0	127746

1368	I've done my best to go through as much as possible on the software and Ive jumped on in and attempted to swim along.	0	134977
1369	However, i THEN found out / noticed I needed to enter in starting balances etc etc to begin with and I basically didnt do this...	0	134977

1371	I've imported my HSBC cvs bank statements from July  1 2014 to Jun 30th - Our Financial Year 2/ I've reconciled the statements with the sales and purchases and naturally a report has been produced...	0	134977
1372	3/ Everything seemed to me seemed ok on the reports4/ My accountant has access to this now, to make life easier (which is what swung me toward using the software as I like the mobile functionality of which I KNOW i can pass on and teach to my colleagues within the business just to help streamline things on a daily basis and stay completely upto date.	0	134977
1373	5/ My accountant has informed me of my balances (from my previous accounting year) though I was going on my bank statement itself 6/ So I entered them into "Conversion Balance" section but apparently still things are not right?	1	134977
1374	Am I doing something wrong ?	3	134977
1375	should I start again (id rather not as I've reconciled things in details, even giving descriptions on many itemsalso, my Xero Balanced don't seem to match up eitherI hope someone can help me as I really don't want to be now going back to excel as this looks like great software.	0	134977

1377	Hi there,What information do I need to work out whether a 3rd party software will link into Xero?	3	139606

1380	Trying to post payroll this afternoon, and when I went to approve the timesheets I get the error message"An error has occured. Your Payslip may be out of sync. Try again in a moment."	1	138130
1381	I have been re-trying for an hour now.	0	138130
1382	I have logged a support request but the response time to that is potentially 24hrs, and I would like to pay the staff today.	0	138130

1384	Hello,I am looking for either a business owner or accountant who is familiar with and knows in detail the pro's and con's of how certain programs work with Xero and can offer advice on a possible solution.	0	139038
1385	I am starting a new business in the UK and i want to sell both retail online and wholesale in person.	0	139038
1386	I have picked Xero as my accounts package, Shopify as my online solution and i am wondering if i can run my business on just that or if i need a inventory app also.	3	139038
1451	Now under my Settings -> Superannuation, I got 2 super funds that I added in.	0	136854
1387	Here are the key issues: I import 100% from overseas with long lead times, so working out costings and creating purchase orders and Invoices months in advance is a question.	0	139038
1388	Is Xero a good program as central data file for products?	3	139038
1389	Does this info flow to shopify or do i need to duplicate data?	3	139038
1390	Are the basic apps for shopify any good for linking to Ebay and Amazon?	3	139038
1391	I dont have a warehouse or staff, i plan to contract out all logistics to a 3PL.	0	139038
1392	I have been looking at inventory apps such as Deer, Unleashed, Trade Gecko or Cin7.	0	139038
1393	Cost is a factor but it would be great to talk to someone who has used any of these with Xero and offer advice.	0	139038
1394	Many ThanksNathan	4	139038
1395	Right, sick of Xero payroll.	0	140003

1398	For small business clients, there should be option for calculating depreciation and disposal and addition for pooled assets.	0	128480
1399	Rules are quite different from normal diminishing value method hence we have to prepare manual work-paper to calculate depreciation and have to post it manually	1	128480
1400	Xero Payroll does not calculate wages based on the employees start date.	1	133937
1401	If your employee starts halfway through a pay run/ pay period, a manual adjustment of their hours and tax will need to be done.	1	133937
1402	For example:	0	133937
1403	1. We use a monthy pay cycle that ends 28th of each month	0	133937
1404	2. We have setup a new employee, set the start date as 5th November 2012	0	133937
1405	3. We have setup employee with annual salary, based of 40 hours work week.	0	133937
1406	4. When we do a pay run, xero calculates the employee worked 23 days worth of hours, instead of 18.	0	133937
1407	It has thus NOT taken into account their start date, but used the entire month.	0	133937
1408	I can work around the problem by adjusting the number of hours after doing a pay run, but this is clearly undesirable and error prone (especially as wage costs are a large part of our business and getting these wrong is costly)	0	133937
1409	Hi I have a case of new fixed asset, where 03 payments were made on different dates to buy the same item.	0	127511

1417	Hi.	0	134704
1418	I'm switching my bank account to The Co-operative Bank UK and I see there's a feed available for (Personal Banking) which I need.	0	134704
1419	Every time I try to set up the feed, Xero tells me that the access to my online banking is locked.	1	134704
1420	On contacting The Co-operative Bank they tell me they have updated their online banking system so that the questions that Xero asks will no longer be acceptable.	0	134704
1421	Could you look into this please as I really need to set this feed up as soon as possible?	3	134704
1422	It seems the questions you need to ask are different and I do know the answers!	0	134704

1427	I used some convenience checks from a credit card to pay some vendors.	0	126366
1428	Xero excludes ALL credit card transactions and PayPal transactions.	0	126366
1429	After some research, it appears as though these transactions do no meet the definition of "purchase card transaction" and as such would not be reported by the PSE (Payment Settlement Entity i.e. the credit card company) on a form 1099-K.	0	126366
1430	Seems like Xero needs to add a check box somewhere that would allow these transactions to flow into the 1099 query report.http://www.marcumllp.com/blog-tax-and-business/new-form-1099-k-filing-requirement-for-merchant-card-and-third-party-network-payments	1	126366

1439	Hi I have only been using xero for a few months and have just noticed that on our profit an loss statement the wages figures are showing up twice once as a net figure and once as a gross figure and therefore throwing out our monthly figures	1	136815

1442	I am coming from Quickbooks and I am setting up my chart of accounts.	0	126837
1443	I am not familiar with setting a tax rate for each account.	0	126837
1444	For example, I have a computer sales account I need to add to record our computer sales in.	0	126837
1445	With Quickbooks I  normally would just set sales tax (7%) per invoice or per item I was selling and the item would be tied to the correct sales account.	0	126837
1446	Do I need to set a tax rate on the actual account if I set tax rate for the item or can I just leave it at zero?	3	126837

1455	Does Xero/ClickSuper automatically draw funds from my bank account to pay the funds for me?	3	136854

1457	Question 3.	0	136854
1458	Some of the guys in company are long-term contractors, so they are not in �Employees� list in Xero, in this case, how do I handle super for them in the system?	3	136854

1460	When a supplier requires a deposit up front with the balance to be paid on delivery, how can duplicate fixed assets in Xero be avoided?	3	133954
1461	We recently ordered custom computer equipment and paid a deposit upon ordering.	0	133954
1462	This transaction created a new fixed asset in Xero that I have since registered.	0	133954
1463	We've now paid the balance owing and this 2nd transaction has created a duplicate fixed asset record.	0	133954
1464	I will probably delete the new fixed asset but would like to be able to have both the deposit and balance payment transactions linked to the asset record.	0	133954
1465	Is this possible in Xero?	3	133954
1466	We have set our default to be Tax Inclusive on our sales invoices but see when we start a new invoice it reverts to Tax Exclusive.	1	139941
1467	Do you have a fix for this as I can't see anything that we could be doing wrong here, as when I go back to check the setting it Tax Inclusive is definitely selected and saved.	3	139941

1494	Is it just me being a Xero novice or is there a way to show a VAT summary table consisting of TaxCode, NetGoodsAmount and TaxTotal on a custom invoice using just the default currency.	3	126642
1495	It seems that Xero will do exactly what I want using the Currency Conversion table but only when the invoice is in a foreign currency.	0	126642
1496	I would like to have a very similar table on invoices using just the default currency.	0	126642
1497	Is this the Achilles heel of Xero?	3	126642
1498	In my previous accounting package (that will remain nameless) I had a VAT summary table on all my invoices (It was impossible to get rid of it!).	0	126642
1499	Nearly every invoice I look at from my suppliers shows the VAT rate, the net total amount it applies to and the corresponding tax total in a table.	0	126642
1500	So what am I doing wrong that means all I can show in Xero is the Tax Code and its Tax Total?	3	126642
1501	I know legally it might not be essential but it's almost a courtesy to whomever has to handle the paperwork.	0	126642
1502	I have asked Xero support but as yet had no reply.	0	126642
1503	Is there anyone in the Xero community that can put me straight, please?	3	126642
1504	I've been on this for three days solid and although I now have improved greatly my understanding of Word am no closer to achieving the invoice template I would like.	3	126642

1511	For bank accounts that are not connected to a bank feed, it would be nice to be able to go to the account transaction page and select each transaction and like you do with remove & redo, have a reconcile option.	1	135252
1512	This eliminates the need to go into each transaction manually to reconcile.	0	135252
1513	Change 'amounts are in...' to 'no tax', and then then either 'tax inclusive', or 'tax exclusive' -- VAT doesn't get updated any more.	1	136174

1520	Through this tax year we've accidentally been using owner funds introduced + owner drawings + directors loan account to record personal money in and out.	0	134960
1521	We're a ltd company, so I want to use just the director's loan account and therefore need to consolidate owners funds introduced and owner drawings into the DLA.	0	134960
1522	I suppose I could go into each of the transactions (mostly expense claims) undo the payments and recode them to the DLA, but this would take some time and every adjustment (i would assume) will appear on our latest VAT return.	1	134960
1523	Is it possible / advised to just make lump sum transfers from the 2 owners accounts into the DLA?	3	134960

1527	I have a large fixed asset register, and 9 months into the tax year it is not feasible to rollback depreciation to the beginning of the year just so that I can dispose of an asset without incurring depreciation in the current year.	1	126374
1528	There have been other disposals and journals created during the course of the year, and repeating the disposal of these assets is not an option.	0	126374
1529	This was not a problem prior to the November 2015 improvements.	0	126374
1530	I have endeavoured to set a zero depreciation rate, which the system will not accept, and also to reset the asset to having no depreciation, which the system will not allow me to do.	1	126374

1545	Hi, My client runs a business in the clothing industry supplying clothing to schools, clubs and businesses.	0	126368
1546	I have set up 2 tracking categories, Size and Colour,  to allow him to use these specifically for invoicing customers.	0	126368
1547	This is a great feature as he can make an appropriate selection on screen while invoicing.	0	126368
1548	My client wants the tracking category of Size and Colour to appear the invoice to his customers.	0	126368
1549	It would appear the tracking category field names are not available to customise the invoice or, I just haven't found them.	1	126368

1554	HI , how do i input opening balances for my customers without importing them ?	3	128558
1555	I cannot find how to achieve this so hope someone can help...	1	125477
1556	Multiple payments (2) were made to a supplier for a number of products (3) received, because a 'difference' payment had to be made a few days later (but before I was invoiced) to account for a change to a superior product.	0	125477
1557	These 2 payments are showing up as separate lines in my company credit card account ready for reconciliation.	0	125477
1558	Using the three separate invoices (that correctly show the 3 products I received) from the supplier I created a transaction (made up of the 3 items) which totalled the same 'spent' value as the 2 credit card account statement lines, however there is no option to 'split' this transaction like there is with invoice payments that I can see?!	1	125477
1559	Therefore when I choose 'match' against either of the statement lines, I can see the transaction, but cannot proceed.	1	125477
1560	Please advise if this requires the implementation of additional functionality or if I should undertake this reconciliation using a different process?	3	125477
1561	Many Thanks / Dan	4	125477

1623	When I look down my list of invoices sent out in the "Invoices Awaiting Payment" page it clearly shows that the most recent invoices not as being sent, I.E. the word "Sent" in green is not showing besides it in the list.	1	128337
1624	If I select the invoice and select it's history it clearly shows three things (for example):Created17 Nov 2015 11:07 a.m. System GeneratedReceived through the Xero API from WorkflowMax Invoice sent 17 Nov 2015 11:30 a.m. Shake AccountsThis invoice has been sent to David@***.co.ukApproved17 Nov 2015 11:31 a.m. Shake Accounts INV6212 to **** Ltd for &#163;99.99.	0	128337
1625	So everything is showing that it appeared in Xero from Workflow Max, was sent via email within Xero and then was approved by me.	0	128337
1626	Surely if it goes through the process of sending the invoice, it should mark it as sent as everything apart from the initial import is done within Xero.	1	128337
1627	(We do generate invoices directly within Xero too and we get the same issue).	0	128337
1628	I must stress, this never affects clients paying, they always receive the invoices, so that is not the issue, the problem is the invoices are simply not showing as sent in searches.	0	128337
1629	Any help greatly appreciated.	4	128337

1643	I currently use Harvest for all my invoicing and link it with Xero to reconcile transactions and prepare BAS.	0	139344
1644	I have noticed on Harvest that when I set up a new invoice it has the following message "Apply Tax From Xero".	0	139344
1645	After starting to put the BAS together today, it looks like Xero is saying that these invoices are BAS excluded.	1	139344
1646	How do I change this?	3	139344
1647	I can't seem to find settings in either Xero or Harvest.	1	139344
1648	It affects reconciliation when Xero picks up a related payment from Harvest (Match) rather than when I create (and can ensure it is included in BAS)	0	139344

1713	Hello Can anyone help me please as I have a tricky problem?	3	136890
1714	The situation is staff are salaried (annual amount/hours = hourly rate) however they are paid monthly in arrears (last day of the month) for the actual number of days worked and not simply Annual salary / 12 months.	0	136890
1715	The issue is their leave needs to be calculated monthly Based on Ordinary Earnings for the month and not just 152 hours / 12 months.	0	136890
1716	When I try and put this into Xero AU Payroll it tells I have to insert a monthly amount of leave calculated.	1	136890

1722	My accountant set up my bank feeds for me.	0	135985
1723	One of them is the situation where only the person who set up the feed can refresh it.	0	135985
1724	This bank feed fails all the time, and every time, like a pest, I have to email my accountant to refresh the feed for me.	1	135985
1725	Both my accountant and I would prefer it if I could refresh the feed.	0	135985
1726	I understand that only the one who added the feed can refresh it - how can I be that person instead of my accountant?	3	135985
1727	If I am the only one who can refresh it, that is perfectly fine.	0	135985
1728	It's just a hassle when SHE is the only one who can refresh it.	1	135985
1729	So is there any way to switch that over?	3	135985
1730	I've tried looking around in Xero to figure out if I can re-enter the bank feed info so that then I will be the special *person* with the permissions, but I haven't been able to find any way to do that.	0	135985

1752	I have submitted my tax return and just paid the tax due to HMRC.	0	125435

1769	HI I have been using xero for 6 months and on the whole it is fantastic.	0	128095
1770	One thing that i would like to see is the credit invoices issued by suppliers to be able to be manually ticked against a payment rather than allocating it to another invoice.	1	128095
1771	As a lot of our credit notes do not correspond with invoices from the supplier and it then becomes difficult for suppliers to match off our invoices from our remittances.	1	128095
1772	Also the fact that each time you load an invoice onto a supplier that has a credit note, a reminder comes up that there is a credit note available,	1	128095
1773	this in turn seems to stop the flow of creating another bill, as it takes you to that invoice if you dont allocate this credit.	1	128095

1790	I am struggling to sort out the best way to handle reconciling two transactions I have in Xero.	0	135142
1791	I have two separate vendors who issued partial refunds after a purchase was made.	0	135142
1792	One was because we were charged too much for shipping and the other because we were charged for an upgrade that we did not end up using.	0	135142
1793	Both of the original expenses were one off expenses paid via credit card and do not have associated bills.	0	135142
1794	They were just reconciled along with other bank transactions.	0	135142
1795	How do I handle the refunds?	3	135142
1796	They don't seem to be overpayments, and I don't have a bill to create a credit note against.	1	135142
1797	I could create bills but is that a best practice?	3	135142
1798	If I just choose to reconcile it and label is as "vendor refund" is it categorized as an asset or as revenue?	3	135142

1807	Hi there,We use Capital On Tap as a regular loans service.	0	126082
1808	There is no option for bank feeds and the loan is paid in as and when we require it (almost like a transfer from a separate account with a loan limit).	0	126082
1809	We then have to pay back a minimum amount every month depending on the cumulative total we have loaned at the end of that month so the amount is never fixed, always variable.	0	126082
1810	I ideally want to record the capital we have received (ad hoc), the amount we have paid back (monthly) and the interest as an expense.	0	126082
1811	The loan was started before we began using Xero so I realise I will need to enter a conversion balance.	0	126082
1812	But I was wondering if anyone had any idea on how to go about recording the payments in, the repayments out and the interest.	3	126082
1813	Would I need to create two accounts, one for loan and one for loan interest?	3	126082
1814	I hope this makes sense and thanks in advance for any help or light you can shed on this.	4	126082

1816	I'm just starting to reconcile after adding Kounta integration, and am not sure how to handle cash purchases made from the cash register.	0	139105
1817	If a supplier is paid cash on delivery from the till, the deducted cash is recorded as "cash out" showing the reduced cash in the till.	0	139105

1849	Is it possible to put through a bad debt differently, such a journal entry, on an accrual scheme so that we can claim the VAT back but stillleave the invoices open in case we do eventually get payments in?	3	125232

1853	I had a case this morning where I needed to quickly add a file to a historical transaction for a known contact and I had to do the following:- Start at the dashboard.- Click on Accounts -> Bank Accounts- Click the correct bank account.- Click the 'Transactions' tab.- Click 'Search', enter the contact name.Click the appropriate transaction from the list that appears.	0	128746

1881	when creating an invoice i include the contact record details (no guid) full details, this normally either creates a new contact or finds and existing one.	0	46022

1892	Hi there,At the moment we use the demo environment.	0	44624
1893	However have three problems with it.	1	44624
1894	One of them is that it does not contain our production data and the second one is that it expires after 30 days.	1	44624
1895	The third problem is that it is bound to one account, which makes it harder for the developers to share one demo environment to test.	1	44624
1896	Does Xero support a sandbox environment or an environment which is a copy of production?	3	44624
1897	Or is it possible to keep the demo environment alive for more then 30 days, including the sharing of the demo account?	3	44624
1898	Thanks and Regards,Keethanjan	4	44624
1899	I'm wondering if there is any way to limit the number of results returned--for example, an equivalent to "SELECT TOP 100" in SQL.We intend to create about 800 invoices per month via the API, and all of them will be created on the same day and have the same invoice date and due date, so I don't think we could use any date fields or "if modified since" to limit the results.	3	46320
1900	  When issuing a GET request on these, ideally, we'd be able to split it up into 8 different API calls; i.e.	1	46320
1901	in the following pseudo code:\tRequest 1 of 8: Get the top 100 records where invoice date is 2012-04-02T00:00:00 order by UpdatedDateUTC\tRequest 2 of 8: Get the top 100 records where invoice date is 2012-04-02T00:00:00 and UpdatedDateUTC > (the last UpdatedDateUTC in Request 1) order by UpdatedDateUTC\tAnd so on, until there are no more records retrieved.\t	2	46320
1902	Is there any way either to limit the records returned or some other way to split up this request into multiple API calls?	3	46320

1911	I find the new .Net library extremely unintuitive and convoluted.	1	45062
1912	Even looking at the example implementations it is not a quick or easy thing to tease out the best way to implement and utilise this myself.	1	45062
1913	I look forward to a straightforward library with straightforward example code of how to implement it.	1	45062

1922	Hi,I am using the Xero API and sending a HTTP GET request from my application to Xero to return Contacts that match a certain Name.	0	45761
1923	So...using instructions from http://developer.xero.com/documentation/getting-started/http-requests-and-responses/#title3, I send (for example) Name="A Company Ltd" urlencoded as part of the URL.	0	45761
1924	This works fine, until I search on a Name that includes a double quote in it.	1	45761
1925	Does anyone know how to get it to work and Xero to not return an error when a double quote exists?	3	45761
1926	I know it's highly unlikely that a Name would have a double quote in it, but it's always best to make an application as robust as possible in my opinion, no matter how unlikely.	0	45761

1928	I'm trying to return all Invoices for June 2013, NOT just those that have been changed since a certain date.	0	45185
1929	I can see how the API documentation handles this situation, it says to use the following value for the where parameter (from http://developer.xero.com/api-overview/http-requests-and-responses/#get-filtered):	0	45185
1930	FullyPaidOnDate >= DateTime(2011, 10, 01) AND FullyPaidOnDate <= DateTime(2011, 10, 30)	2	45185
1931	However I'd like to use the useful xero.php wrapper if possible.	1	45185
1932	After reading the github page and various discussions on here as well as the code, it looks to me as if the filter I should be setting is as follows (ie the 'value' of the array item is itself an array made up of operand, literal value):	0	45185
1933	$aFilter = array(\t'Date' => array('>=','DateTime(2013, 06, 01)')\t,'Date' => array('<=','DateTime(2013, 06, 30)'));$result = $xero->Invoices('','',$aFilter,'');	2	45185
1934	However this results in the following error:Array(    [ErrorNumber] => 16    [Type] => QueryParseException    [Message] => Operator '<=' incompatible with operand types 'DateTime?' and 'String')	1	45185
1935	Also of course as the field name is the array key, I only end up with one array item not two as you can see in the array dump:	1	45185
1936	Array(    [Date] => Array        (            [0] => <=            [1] => DateTime(2013,06,30)        ))	2	45185

1944	Hi all. I'm a newbie web developer and also new to xero api.	0	45763
1945	What I am asking is simple. How to create the function for a GET/POST request for invoices?	3	45763
1946	I have looked at the api previwer, understand the xml but not how to implement the "run" button function	1	45763
1947	Any sample code to look at including a submit button?	3	45763
1948	I have been uploading Timesheets to Xero successfully in an application in C# for over 12 months.	0	44963
1949	With the latest revision of the app (no changes to the codeline used for the Timesheets upload), I am no longer able to do the uploads and am getting a BadRequest exception raised.	1	44963
1950	The detail merely shows "A validation exception occurred".	1	44963
1951	I have the Api.Timesheets.Create in a try/catch block, with three separate catch blocks.	0	44963
1952	The first of these is:catch (Xero.Api.Infrastructure.Exception.ValidationException vE){.....}but this is not trapping.	1	44963
1953	The second catch block is for BadRequestException and that traps.	0	44963
1954	How can I then determine the actual Validation errors?	3	44963
1955	The full ValidationException block contains::\terrStore += "Validation errors from xero:\\r\\n";\tforeach (var v in vE.ValidationErrors)\t{\t\terrStore += v.Message + "\\r\\n";\t\tAppGlobals.logger.Error("Error: TS Upload error" + v.Message + "\\r\\n");\t}	1	44963
1956	but with that not being trapped how can I find the errors?	3	44963
1957	Why does the BadRequest exception supersede the ValidationException, or are there multiple exceptions occurring?	3	44963
1958	It makes life fairly difficult when my client cannot determine what has gone wrong without my having to get into debug mode on a production system.	1	44963
1961	I want to test my application against different scenarios so it will be great if we can "induce" token expiration instead of having to wait 30 minutes for it to systematically expire.	1	46916
1962	I am using a public application and official PHP Xero API wrapper.	0	46916
1963	Thanks!	4	46916
1964	Why is it that Xero will not accept an email address with numeric characters in the TLD either by API or manual Contact entry?	3	44426
1965	There are TLDs which have numeric character in them listed on IANA - http://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt  (scroll down to .XN domains).	0	44426
1966	(encoded as "xn--mgberp4a5d4ar") ("al-Saudiah") in Arabic Script,which is registered to the Saudi Network Information Centre	0	44426

1969	Hi,I have a web app that requires invoicing, inventory and payroll access to insert timesheets.	0	46159
1970	Have got it working using the core api Version 2 & have got hold of the payroll DotNet sample (which looks to be the same as the core api sample with a console payroll section).	0	46159
1971	Anyway the example doesn't show the situation where I wan to use both api's...i.e I want to process invoices using the core api and then turn the page to payroll and insert time-sheets.	1	46159
1972	Do I have to log out of 1 and log into the other?	3	46159
1973	Can I use the same access token to create both payroll and core repositories?	3	46159
1974	Any examples of the above in DotNet?	3	46159
1975	First scenario:I am using the PUT method to create an invoice in Xero,	0	45385
1976	I have an issue with the lineAmount when a CurrencyRate apply.	1	45385
1977	This is one of my LineItems in my Invoice XML:LineItem\tDescription: EDGA01:INVBE3983:Travel\tLineAmount: 66.201300\tTaxAmount: 0.0000\tAccountCode: RET300\tCurrency fields as part of the Invoice XML:CurrencyCode: USDCurrencyRate: 0.0743The lineItem in the response from XERO, looked like this for the above line item:{          "Description": "EDGA01:INVBE3983:Travel",          "UnitAmount": 66.20,          "TaxType": "NONE",          "TaxAmount": 0.00,          "LineAmount": 66.20,          "AccountCode": "RET300",          "Tracking": ,          "Quantity": 1.0000,          "LineItemID": "732ca155-e1bc-4fe0-bb77-504f25540034",          "ValidationErrors": },	2	45385
1978	Why does the LineAmount change to 66.20, does XERO only accepts 2 decimal points?	3	45385
1979	Second scenario:I decided to send through the lineAmount with 2 decimal points.	0	45385
1980	This is one of my LineItems in my Invoice XML:LineItem\tDescription: ILLI11:INVBE3985:Setup\tLineAmount: 224.25\tTaxAmount: 0.00\tAccountCode: ASC400Currency fields as part of the Invoice XML:CurrencyCode: EURCurrencyRate: 0.0690	2	45385
1981	So according to my understanding Xero should do a reverse calculation for the value in the Revenue account: 224.25 % 0.0690 = R3250.00, but instead the Revenue account reports R3249.99	1	45385
1982	Hi,I am trying to modify a paid invoice by changing the account_code for given line item. I can modified unpaid invoice with out a problem.	0	45515
1983	However once the payment exist, I receive the error: "Invoice not of valid status for modification"Which makes sense, however I was hoping since I am able to change the item account code easily on the web UI, even if an payment has been created,    that I could do the same thing via the API.	1	45515

1997	Here's my code.Dim wInvoice As New XeroApi.Model.Invoice        Dim wContact As New XeroApi.Model.Contact        Dim Contact Name As String        ContactName = "Test Contact"        Dim myContacts = From contacts In repository.Contacts                         Where contacts.Name = ContactName        For Each myContact As XeroApi.Model.Contact In myContacts            Dim myContactID As String = myContact.ContactID.ToString            wContact.ContactID = New System.Guid(myContactID)            wInvoice.Contact = wContact            wInvoice.InvoiceNumber = "TEST"            wInvoice.Date = "10-29-2015"            wInvoice.Type = "ACCREC"            wInvoice.DueDate = "10-30-2015"            wInvoice.Status = "DRAFT"            wInvoice.LineItems = New XeroApi.Model.LineItems            Dim wLineItem = New XeroApi.Model.LineItem            wLineItem.Quantity = 2            wLineItem.Description = "Item1"            wLineItem.ItemCode = 9            wInvoice.LineItems.Add(wLineItem)            wLineItem = New XeroApi.Model.LineItem            wLineItem.Quantity = 3            wLineItem.Description = "Item2"            wLineItem.ItemCode = 1            wInvoice.LineItems.Add(wLineItem)            wLineItem = New XeroApi.Model.LineItem            wLineItem.Quantity = 4            wLineItem.Description = "Item3"            wLineItem.ItemCode = 17            wInvoice.LineItems.Add(wLineItem)            Dim sResults = repository.Create(Of XeroApi.Model.Invoice)(wInvoice)            If sResults.ValidationErrors.Count = 0 Then                MsgBox("Invoice Created")            Else                For Each something In sResults.ValidationErrors                    MsgBox(something.Message)                Next            End If        Next	2	45018

1999	With a payment that is part of a bulk payment this returns the first purchase invoice associated with the bulk payment rather than the correct purchase invoice	1	45181
2000	based on the payment amount it seems like a bulk payment divides into smaller payments but the invoice does not correspond)	1	45181
2001	foreach (Payment vo_payment in repository.Payments.Where(x => (x.Date > datebegin && x.Date < dateend && !(x.Status == "DELETED" || x.Status == "VOIDED") && x.Invoice.Type == "ACCPAY")))                {                    vs_paymentstring = Convert.ToDateTime(vo_payment.Date).ToString("yyyyMMdd") + "_" + vo_payment.Invoice.InvoiceNumber + "_(" + vo_payment.PaymentID + ")";	2	45181
2002	Hi there,Firstly, apologies if this is in the wrong place.	0	45011
2003	There were at least 3 possible places this question could've been created, but I figured as I'm using wrapper code it should go here.	0	45011
2004	I'm using the .NET Xero API SDK 2.0.20 in C#.I'm trying to send an invoice to a customer upon payment.	0	45011
2005	It should be sent with the invoice in a paid state (so there is no confusion).	0	45011
2006	I've got the code down good to apply the payment to the invoice, and sending the e-mail goes fine.	0	45011
2007	But then when we try to update the invoice to say it's been sent out, I get the following validation errors:* "Invoice not of valid status for modification"* "This document cannot be edited as it has a payment or credit note allocated to it."	1	45011
2008	Here is some of the code I'm using. {\t// bits and bobs to get the payment made\t_privateAppApi.Payments.Create(payment);\tEmailInvoice(payment);\tUpdateXeroInvoiceSentToContact(payment.Invoice);}private void UpdateXeroInvoiceSentToContact(XeroModels.Invoice invoice){\tinvoice.SentToContact = true;\t_privateAppApi.Invoices.Update(invoice);}	2	45011
2009	Any ideas of how this could/should be handled?	3	45011
2010	I thought about trying to set the sent status first, then applying the payment and then sending the e-mail. The problem with this approach is that I'd get caught out again if something went wrong sending the e-mail, I wouldn't then be able to set SentToContact to false, because a payment has been applied. Which doesn't feel quite right.	1	45011
2011	Any help appreciated.Cheers,Craig	4	45011
2012	I am trying to work out the best way to update an existing Timesheet (Australian Payroll API), without replacing or overwriting the existing TimesheetLines.	0	45868
2013	At the moment when POSTING and specifying the TimesheetID, the existing TimesheetLines are lost.	1	45868
2014	Also if the Timesheet is Approved then you can no longer POST to it.	1	45868
2015	Having to rePOST the entire TimesheetLines content seems odd.	1	45868
2016	Suggestions very welcome.	4	45868
2017	We have developed an integration between our software (a .Net Winforms application) with Xero,        allowing the user to import revenue and expense transactions using the API, into our software.	0	46784
2018	At the moment, every time the user wants to execute this import from within our software, they are presented with a Xero authentication page,         where they enter in the username and password, and then on a second page, select the ‘organisation’ they want to allow our software to access    (screenshot  https://www.screencast.com/t/JCwxMns3bW8 )	0	46784
2019	I see that there is an ‘Allow access for 30 mins’ option, which saves them from having to login multiple times, however it still always prompts the user during this 30min period to select the Xero organisation.	1	46784
2020	Is it possible for us to capture and store their Xero username / password, and the organisation that they have originally selected, within our software, so we can programmatically use them in the future?	3	46784
2021	So each time they would want to execute an import, they won’t have to login or select their organisation again. Is this possible to do with Xero?	4	46784
2022	Our AffinityLive product allows users to record expenses against a project.	0	46210
2023	In some cases they may not be personal expenses but ones paid for already by a business credit card or chequebook, etc.	0	46210
2024	We are wondering if these expenses can be pushed through to Xero via the API.	3	46210
2025	My understanding is that these are not Expense Claims assigned to a user, but are more general business expenses which are recorded differently.	1	46210
2026	We're a bit lost on how to proceed - part of the problem of course is that we're not accountants and may be taking the wrong approach!	1	46210
2027	Appreciate any advice.	4	46210
