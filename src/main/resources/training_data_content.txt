954	URGENTI am absolutely appalled at the service provided by Xero.
955	I have been asking for a call, and nobody will call.
956	Xero claims, they are happy to call you.
957	I disagree.
958	I have asked 3 times now, and you will not.
959	Please call 07740306490 and help my bookkeeper.
960	Thank you
961	Hello,  I need to set up a Dishonoured Payment account in my chart of accounts to record the fraudulent "receive money" transaction from our customer and the bank retrieval "spend money" transaction.
962	Can anyone please help with where I set this account up in my chart of accounts.
963	thanksKathryn
964	When I import bills in Purchases it works fine but it doesn't update the cost in Inventory.
965	Is this by design or is there a way to allow this.
966	Otherwise I have to manually maintain my inventory costs.
967	I have read what I can and searched the forum but can't find any info on this
968	Anyone know an answer?
969	Thanks, Richard
970	Hi All,I use Box (www.box.com) extensively for cloud based storage.
971	It would be great if there was an option to Export a PDF of any report to your Box account from the Export Button (Currently there are options for PDF, Excel and Google Docs only).
972	Now I have to export to PDF, Save to my desktop then drag into Box.
973	I know you can publish reports in Xero, but I generally only publish final documents, not reports I use for working papers etc.
974	Hi all.
975	I'm looking for something that will use my client list out of Xero.
976	I need it to do email merge...
977	Anyone recommend anything?
978	I'm trying to find a definitive answer but had no luck.
979	My employer wants me to be able to pay employees direct from zero without accessing online banking.
980	It doesn't seem to be an option.

986	Has anyone out in the Xero Community done a large scale change to their chart of accounts?
987	We are planning a large change, and just curious to see how others might have tackled it.
988	I wanted to keep an original "copy/backup" of our data up to 12/31/2015 and then roll over a new copy/database for 2016 and make the changes there.
989	However, Xero doesn't work similarly to QB, where you can download a copy of the database and store.
990	It was suggested to do a major upload of the new GL codes, however - that seems fraught with issues and potential overwriting, and less out of our control, if you are switching codes one by one.
991	Thoughts?

1003	I have to post in journals for a client payroll but the site won't allow me.
1004	The charter of accounts shows 'wages payable' as locked and automatically updated through the software's pay run facility(which we are not using).
1005	Is there any way to unlock this?
1006	Xero currently isn't recording the expense part of salary sacrifice transactions correctly.
1007	At present the pre sacrifice amounts allocated to gross wages.
1008	I would expect the sacrificed amount should be allocated to the appropriate expense.
1009	For example where there is a gross wage of $1200 and $200 sacrificed for superannuation the gross wage of $1200 goes to wages expense and none of the sacrifice to superannuation expense.
1010	This means each month/quarter/year manual journals are needed to correct the allocation.
1011	This becomes more important with other types of salary sacrifice, such as motor vehicles where GST applies.
1012	It would be good to add an expense account to pre tax deduction pay items that auto posts the debit to the appropriate expense and credit to the wages expense account.
1013	Alternatively if we have the option for the account in the payroll item to be more than just a liability account as is presently the case.
1014	This would at least allow the credit entry to be allocated against wages.
1015	This would then shows correct gross wages and allow the salary sacrifice expense to be managed separately.
1016	Hi guys!
1017	I have a New Zealand Invoice (I am in Australia) that I have just paid via Forex (so in AUD into a Forex bank account here in Australia).
1018	How on earth do I enter that into Xero?
1019	Any advice would be appreciated!
1020	We are a builder and have a large number of small invoices from wholesalers.
1021	These we pay in two or more large payments.
1338	Thanks
1022	However they often do not match exactly to a certain number of invoices, can you part allocate a payment to an invoice, leaving a remaining balance to clear off with the next invoice.
1023	i cannot find any option to process an employee leaver and therefore produce a P45 document?
1024	any help much appreciated
1025	I like to run my eye down the account transaction to make sure that ever transaction has an invoice attachment.
1026	The problem is if you create a bill and reconcile it, it doesn't register that there is an attachment unless you click on the invoice in the description.
1027	Having to go through two or three windows to make sure every transaction has an attachment can take a lot of time.
1028	Is there a way for the account transaction page to register the bill that has been reconciled with that transaction has an attachment?
1029	Thanks
1030	I have just used payroll for the first time, and on my first pay run, the PAYG YTD is double the amount it should be.

1034	We have off-site staff with debit cards.
1035	We have set them up as Users with the  "Invoice Only- Invoice=Purchases Only" user role.
1036	They need to be able to access Spend Money in order to take pictures of their receipts and code to gl accounts for their debit card purchases.
1037	The mobile app is not showing the + (plus) sign to access spend money.
1038	We obviously do not want to provide greater levels of access to the staff.
1039	Is anyone using the mobile app/Spend Money with off-site staff and what User role have you had to assign to accomplish this?
1040	Hi,our year end was 31st December 2016.
1041	I have a conversion balance in opening stock from 31st December 2015.
1042	No other adjustments to stock have been made for the year 2016 so it has a YTD value of 0.00.
1043	We don't use the inventory within Xero as it doesn't suit our business needs.
1044	I have a figure for closing stock and am not sure where to journal the figures from / to.
1045	My logic would be to leave the opening stock figure as it is.
1046	Then credit my direct costs and debit closing stock with our closing stock figure?
1047	I'm a bit confused with how to handle this in Xero.
1048	Sage seemed more straightforward :/
1049	Any advice would be appreciated.
1050	Many thanks
1051	Hi, Got a serious issue this morning when trying to open old files uploaded in AP by receipt bank.

1070	Has anybody had experience accounting for Groupon deal payments in Xero?
1071	'Hi All,It would appear that when I run reports such as profit & loss that it calculates the sales etc when the invoice was dated and not when payment is received.

1073	Any help would be appreciated.
1074	Cheers
1075	Hiya, new to Xero and having a few issues, can anyone please advise me:I have bank fed and reconciled my accounts so that they balance.
1076	Do I now need to add in company receipts and invoices paid to bills, or am I just repeating the process that reconciling does??
1077	if so what is the point in having "Bills you need to pay"
1078	Thanks in advance
1079	We love to hear how business owners are working with their accountant or bookkeeper beyond traditional compliance work.
1080	Share stories of what you've been doing with your advisors now you're collaborating together on Xero.
1081	When trying to edit invoices and quotes, the "reference number" on the invoice/quote keeps coming up as the invoice number.
1082	e.g. Invoice No. - INV-0019Reference should be - "customers name"but it comes up as INV-0019I went onto the .docx file but it shows the <<invoiceNumber>> where the invoice number is and <<reference>> where reference is.
1083	Any ideas?
1084	This Xero  shows the process of entering receipts.
1085	 It starts with the mobile app, and then moves to the browser and at 50 seconds says "just like the mobile app fill in the expense".
1086	Except from what I can see, it's not just like the mobile app.
1087	In the mobile app the user can assign expenses just as I'd expect any expense app to work, by assigning them to a category ("meals")  also to the account it was paid from, i.e. a company credit card or by the employee etc.
1088	In the browser I see no way to select the account the expense was paid from, and therefore no way for the approver to know how the transaction was even paid for.
1089	Or for that matter for Xero to know where to assign the transaction?
1090	What am I missing??
1091	Thanks
1092	I can't find a way to nominate an Bank account as closed (so no new transactions) but keep it in the system until the end of financial year.
1093	Has anyone done this??
1094	regards Ian
1095	I have a new situation.
1096	A contractor who I normally pay had an invoice owing to me (she pays a base rent when doesn't bring in any income).
1097	She had not paid by the time her next "payment" from me was made so I deducted the "monies owing" (invoice amount) from the bill amount I paid her.
1098	This means that I now have 2 items to deal with:1.  the original invoice she owed eg. $500 looks like its still owing2.  the payment I made to her looks like a part payment of a bill -ie I created the bill as usual for her consulting fees -then deducted what she owed me.
1099	So bill $2000 -I paid her $1500.
1100	Any ideas on how to rectify?
1101	I am working with a client who originally set up their company file in September and added some transactions to the end of the year but did not really start using Xero until January 1, 2012.
1102	If I change the conversion date to 12/31/11 what happens to the prior transactions?
1103	Does Xero ignore them?
1104	Do we need to void them?
1105	Just trying to figure out the most efficient way to do this.

1112	Hi there,I've successfully been doing payroll for a couple of months, but in December I have a strange occurrence.
1113	I set the payment up automatically in my bank account so it was paid over the holidays.
1114	I then reconciled when it came through into Xero.
1115	But now in my payroll report it shows a deficit for December with the value in brackets.
1116	Does anyone have any thoughts on why this might be?
1117	I thought it might be a coding issue but that seems to be fine.
1118	The bank account statements match correctly.
1119	Any help would be greatly appreciated!

1128	Hi all,I'm in Canada, and my business is able to file GST using the "quick method".
1129	In short, this method is designed to reduce administrative work for small businesses and allows them to pay GST calculated using an approximation of tax owed, based on sales, rather than based on the actual amount collected/paid.
1130	So, for example, I have a sales tax account that says I owe the government $1,000 but the quick method means I only actually owe them $900.
1131	How can I make an adjustment to my accounts to show that my sales tax owing has reduced by $100?
1132	I tried to do a manual journal, but that doesn't work as a manual journal must have equal credits and debits.
1133	Thanks,-Peter
1134	We have a client who uses Farmlands pre the merger of the the 2 firms.
1135	Can we set up in Xero Using the CRT Co-Op bank feeds form
1136	When sending out payslips to clients, is it possible to add a second email address (CC'd) that is copied in on each email, we have had a few instances where we have sent Payslips to our clients from Xero and they have confirmed none receipt?
1137	If we can't add the option of a cc'd email address, is it possible to utilise a function that is available for invoices when completed - status is shown as sent and then viewed?
1138	Hi,We are a high volume store that processes over a hundred transactions per day.
1139	The amount that are paid via EFTPOS show up in the bank as a single transaction (one for each EFTPOS machine).
1140	Obviously, banked cash shows up as a single deposit.
1141	The problem is, I want to be able to enter sales separated by department of the store, as our expenses are recorded.
1142	The way we did this with Reckon was an EFT Clearing account, and an Undeposited Funds account, which we then entered a manual journal weekly that credited Sales accounts and debited these two clearing accounts.
1143	When the money hit the bank, this was credited as coming from these clearing accounts.
1144	I was wondering if there was a better way of doing this in Xero, as it is a lot of manual data entry every week for every store!
1145	Thanks for your input!
1146	Jonathon.
1147	I know that this has likely been asked elsewhere, but I am curious to know whether or not sales invoices and purchase invoices can be partly auto-filled based on previous entries?
1148	And, if this is possible, can this feature be switched on and off.
1149	Thanks
1150	Why not have as a standard tax code 'Purchases for private use or not income tax deductible'?
1151	This would allow 'entertainment expenses' and 'motor vehicle private use' for example to be set to this tax code thereby automatically populating G15.
1152	Also note the word 'deductible' is currently spelt incorrectly on Xero's GST Calc W'sheet!

1164	I'm just getting started with Xero and have a few questions.
1165	I converted my books from Quickbooks.
1166	#1 - How is the statement balance calculated in Xero?
1167	My Xero balance is spot on with my bank account, but the statement balance is some number that has never been a statement ending balance or a daily balance in my checking account.
1168	I tried following the steps if the two balances don't match, but nothing has worked. 
1169	I figure if I understand how it comes up with it I may be able to tweak some things.
1170	#2 - Reconciliation seems to encompass much more than I'm used to.
1171	To me a reconciliation is when you match all your entered transactions with an end of month statement to make sure you have entered everything correctly.
1172	I don't see a way to do this in Xero.
1173	Xero seems to only reconcile transactions with daily downloads from the bank.
1174	Is there a way to reconcile with a bank statement as well?

1194	Hi all,I would like to record all outbound payments within Xero.
1195	I was hoping to record payments in Xero as and when we pay by bacs or card payment over the phone.
1196	This works fine when we have been invoiced.
1197	However, we are on proforma invoicing with some of our suppliers.
1198	In these instances we tend to pay the proforma, await the invoice before processing into Xero.
1199	We then spend too long allocating payments as there can be a time before the invoice ends up in Xero.
1200	I envisaged some sort of merging proforma and invoice together but I don't really know what is the correct practice with managing these types of transactions.
1201	Any help would be much appreciated.
1202	Thanks,Richard
1203	Bought 100 Widgets at $10 each on credit card 1, created a bill for $1,000Upon inspection, 10 widgets were damaged, and returned to the supplier.
1204	They issued a refund to a different credit card.
1205	Credit card 1 shows $1000 expense Credit card 2 shows -$100 ('income')I discovered a Bill couldn't be used for a negative value.
1206	I understand that a credit note can be created, but since the inventory has been reduced already I think applying the credit note might not work?
1207	Wondering if an invoice for the 10 widgets with a credit note is the answer?
1208	Or just an invoice?
1209	Or something else entirely?
1210	Thanks in advance for any ideas.
1211	Hello,Still getting to grips with Xero.
1212	I am doing my my first pay run and the PAYE, Employee NIC and Employer NIC have correctly deducted from the final amount in 'Step 2. Enter Employee Payments' however, when clicking through to 'Step 3. Review' they are  as 'Other payments'.
1213	I have tried changing options but have had no success yet.
1214	I have classed the 3 pay items above as paid to a contact I created called HMRC - is this correct?
1215	Any help appreciated.
1216	My business fixes turf machinery like mowers ect. and we carry a lot of stock eg. bearings, belts ect. We need a simple barcoding system that we scan when it arrives and then scans when we've used it and transfers the data to Xero.
1217	We've tried stuff like Dear and Unlimited and it just doesn't work.
1218	Open to suggestions.
1219	Where can you view the postings of the payroll journal?
1220	i have an employee who is over the age limit for super and now suddenly its telling me i have to pay them
1221	I have a new client that has been using Xero for over a year.
1222	He has some old, unmatched bank transactions from a previous year - so irrelevant - and wants them to just go away.
1223	Could someone please explain how to delete them.
1224	Thank you
1225	Hi I'm setting this up for the first time today.
1226	I've chosen my conversion date to be 1/1/13 so I can start the new year off correctly.
1227	Now I'm confused because I'm setting up my bank feed and I'm being asked to choose which transactions to import - all available or starting on a certain date.
1228	Is it wrong to import transactions before Jan 1?
1229	Thanks.

1233	HiLooking for recommendations for a POS system that sends sales to Xero from my clients cash register in his shop.
1234	My client sells pet foods so has different tax rates and needs to identify these for VAT purposes.
1235	Currently my client has a POS system that scans the barcode of the goods and feeds these direct to sage.
1236	Ideal is to have something very similar to this so as not to disrupt their business unnecessarily
1237	Working in both the UK and Ireland we have staff i both locations.
1238	The full payroll features for the UK should be extended to included using Xero within Ireland.
1239	We have a client who sends a fixed price purchase order which is then used for a quarter.
1240	Is there a way to track how much of a client's PO has been billed through Xero?
1241	I was looking at the quote feature but not sure how this would fit the bill...
1242	I have a private loan, registered under 900 � Loan in the chart of accounts.
1243	There's no interest on the loan.
1244	Question 1Company capital from loan
1245	One part of this loan is to pay a third-party to set up the company.
1246	The other part (let's say 50% to keep it simple) is capital to be put into the company.
1247	Should this be registered in conversion balances under "881 - Owner A Funds Introduced"?
1248	Question 2Paying back the loan
1249	I would like to budget a payback of the loan, over X number of months, but I'm unsure where to put it.
1250	I'm going over the "Overall budget" but I can't seem to find any sensible place to budget for the payback.
1251	Thank you so much in advance for your kind help!
1252	Hi community,I'm new to Xero (and very much new to accounting as well, oh the joys).
1253	I have setup my PayPal feed and it has imported all the transaction lines correctly.
1254	However the transaction lines pull in the gross value which excludes the paypal fees.
1255	How do i show that i have had a fee on certain transactions in Xero?
1256	What i done on my previous system was every month tally up the paypal fees and add an entry of that value.
1257	What is recommended?
1258	Hi everyoneI appreciate that this basic question might be beyond the scope of the forum, but I'm trying to inform HMRC of the fact that this is the end of year PAYE submission.
1259	There's a KB article on the Xero site which in turn sends me to a YouTube video from the HMRC about ticking a box on a page in the HMRC portal to tell them that the most recent submission was the last of the year, but I can't see that anywhere.
1260	Given that the video is a bit old, am I to assume that Xero will inform HMRC that this PAYE submission is the last of the year?
1261	I'm confused as to how that last piece of the puzzle works.
1262	I've done my PAYE reconciling and worked through the list of check points in the Xero article.
1263	There's only me on the payroll so I can't imagine that anything can go too wrong.
1264	ThanksOlly
1265	Good morning,I wanted to give some feedback on one of the connected apps Veeqo.
1266	This is an inventory management company and having investigated all of the apps this one came out the best for price and features.
1267	Unfortunately Veeqo is massively let down by the lack of customer service and knowledge that the staff have.
1268	We have had many issues since we started to use Veeqo and these have been addressed by the staff.
1269	However, it is incredibly time consuming to get a response, impossible to speak to someone by phone, and became evident that although we went through several induction sessions to discuss the workings of our business Veeqo had not understood our requirements.
1270	The planned meetings we had with various members of staff were regularly late commencing and on occasion did not happen at all.
1271	The response to this was "These thing happen in business"Finally when I tried to submit a complaint it proved impossible to speak to a manger and after over a week of constant e-mails from us we finally receive a response that accepts no responsibility and no solution.
1272	I have worked with many Xero connected apps and as a rule they have all been successful, the companies have been helpful and staff incredibly knowledgeable and forthcoming.
1273	Most importantly I have always been able to get hold of someone if there have been any issues.
1274	We have now moved to a new Inventory control system (slightly more expensive) and have already seen a massive improvement in service.
1275	I am positive as with most things people have had positive experiences with Veeqo however I wanted to provide feedback for anyone else who is looking for an Inventory add on.
1276	Thanks
1277	Hello,As my employees do not know the business' nor my twelve month plan.
1278	I prefer that a face to face discussion with myself takes place in the future in regards putting in for leave.
1279	Once we have agreed and discussed all the pros and cons then I would like to enter it in to the Leave section.
1280	At the moment It has given them to much control to discuss and organise their lives around each other without knowing any fundamentals of what is expected at those times of the business and without and consultation.
1281	Way to much chit chat already about the Easter break.
1282	After the fact puts me in an awkward situation, and it was never like that until these portals arrived.
1283	I would like pop up options for admin that has a block effect in this case.
1284	That says "Your employer ass per company policy will need to speak to you before holiday/Leave entry times are requested".
1285	Thank you Fabian
1286	In California - and perhaps other states - goods which are purchased for resale are exempt from Sales Tax on that purchase.
1287	However some vendors charge tax at the time of sale because they aren't set up to handle resale customers.
1288	In this case, the sales taxes paid on goods for resale may be used as an offset against sales tax liability (the forwarding of sales taxes collected on goods sold to the taxing authority).
1289	How should I set up Xero so when I pay sales taxes on goods purchased for resale I can see those amounts on my sales tax report and properly deduct them from my sales tax liability?
1290	We are considering using Xero as a replacement for our existing bespoke system.
1291	The guidelines suggest Xero is suitable for 200-500 invoice per month.
1292	Has anybody any experience of posting more invoices and what happens!
1293	Hi all, I have two basic questions that I was unable to locate in a search:
1294	1.) When importing goods from overseas, I am reconciling the transaction at this point without GST.
1295	Do I record this as 'No Tax' or 'Tax Exclusive'?
1296	2.) I am paying the GST as the goods arrive into NZ customs thus there is a separate transaction for the GST alone.
1297	How do I reconcile this?
1298	Can I reconcile this as the 820 GST Liability?
1299	Thanks in advance from a small business owner :)
1300	How do I split or apportion depreciation expense over various teams using the Auto-Depreciate feature in the FAR?
1301	It seems you can only allocate one team when setting up the asset in the FAR
1302	Xero has not been prompting for any payroll tax because my s-corp has not paid any payroll this year (yet) to its employee (myself self employed).
1303	I am in state of Virginia, USA.
1304	Do I need to file a form, pay business state and federal income tax on a quarterly/monthly basis for what my corporation has been generating income every month?
1305	Or will it be due annually when filed if owed?
1306	A client of mine has been using the new discount feature on sales invoices which is a really handy feature, the problem is that the discount does not appear in the standard .docx template.
1307	We have not modified this template in any way so I would have expected this to show up as a line item somewhere.
1308	Discounts do show up on the regular (non .docx) branding theme.
1309	Am I missing something or do Xero need to modify their .docx documents to present discounting?
1310	Many thanksSean
1311	I am trying to find a way to separate the invoices and packing slips, so that when I use "Print PDF" it prints both, but when I email I can just email the invoice and not the packing slip.
1312	I am getting some confused customers wondering why they get a copy of the packing slip everytime I email the invoice.
1313	Hi there,We have some staff paid monthly and one staff member in particular has a few leave requests throughout the month.
1314	Each leave period shows as a separate line on his payslip.
1315	The payslip looks messy with the multiple leave lines with nothing to differentiate them apart from the number of hours taken and even some of those figures are the same.
1316	Is there a way to just make it show as one line or to get details of the leave dates added?
1317	Thanks,Candice
1318	Hello everyoneWe have done our payroll on Xero for the first time in April 2015.
1319	We noticed that the Employment Allowance is not deducted from the PAYE due payable to HMRC automatically.
1320	Xero noted that we need to make a journal entry to be able to claim this.
1321	The relevant boxes have been ticked as required.
1322	How do we do this and how do we know the exact amount to be deducted.
1323	Any comments is greatly appreciated.
1324	Many kind regardsSylet
1325	Hi,When renting our office we paid a security deposit.
1326	How do i record that in Xero so that we get reminded at the end of the lease to collect it.
1327	We would like to set up a control.
1328	Best,
1329	Hi there,We have just migrated over to Xero from Free Agent, and have noticed we have a tonne of sales invoices listed under our "awaiting payment" tab, that aren't marked as "sent".
1330	However, when I go into the invoice detail it says "awaiting payment"
1331	Can I therefore assume that these HAVE been sent (even though its' not marked as such) and that I don't need to resend these again?
1332	FYI these mainly seem to relate to recurring invoices.
1333	I've also checked under "history and notes" section, but it's not listed here either.
1334	Any info gratefully received!
1335	If employees do not have hours in this payrun should I delete the timesheet for them before I process the payrun?
1336	If I leave them intact (I haven't input to them), the pay run generates a small payment for them due to tax refund.
1337	In Sage, I would have set these to 'On Hold' this week.
1339	Hi,Our Employees, like many other companies in Australia, can accrue a maximum of 76 hours personal leave, once they have reached the 76 we should be able to set a ceiling so it accrues no further.
1340	Resetting to 0 annually doesn't work as an employee who hasn't taken any time off is still entitled to their 76 hours.
1341	Example: Jim has been working for Company A for 14 months, he hasn't had any time off for personal/carers leave, he gets sick and needs 3 days off so his personal leave balance should reflect 53.2 hours and start accruing again at the weekly rate of 1.4615 until it again reaches 76 hours.
1342	Without a ceiling the accrual is not reflective of actual entitlements and we need to manually go back through the last 12 months for an employee and see how many hours they have taken and subtract that from amount accrued in that period and add the balance accrued before that period.
1343	Or we need to make a manual adjustment every week for employees who have reached the maximum.
1344	It's all very messy and could be easily fixed with a settable ceiling.
1345	Hi,My inventory items don't show in bills.
1346	They show in invoices on the customer side and in the inventory list itself but they're not available for use in bills - there's nothing there at all.
1347	Anyone got any ideas on this one please?
1348	RegardsDave
1349	HelloMy client just change from MYOB to XERO but I am a new XERO'S user, so I am a bit confuse about how to manage some accounts.
1350	My client has 2 businesses and he pays bills from any of the businesses' accounts, so we are managing it as a inter-companies loans.
1351	In MYOB we had set up a credit car account for the inter-companies loan.
1352	When the company paid other's company bills, we did spend money from the bank account and increase the loan account balance.
1353	When the other company's paid an expense of this company then we transfer the money to the credit card and decrease the balance.
1354	When we received a payment in this account that was other company's service we did a receive money and decrease the balance.
1355	We did something similar with ATO Integrated account.
1356	We created a credit card account, then spend money when we need to enter the GST, PYG, interest etc and transfer money when the payments were done.
1357	I was able to reconciled it with the ATO statements.
1358	Could I work in the same way in XERO or it looks as a messy books if the  credit card accounts are not reconciled (in the Loan case)?
1359	How best does one offset an equal debtor and creditor balance that is due to/from the same entity?
1360	I want to sell a fixed asset to an entity at Net Book Value to a connected party.
1361	Having followed the help section this will raise a sales invoice (@ nil profit) and raise a trade debtor.
1362	That same party will also bill me separately a management fee for the same amount.
1363	This means there will be no cash or VAT impact on either party.
1364	However it does leave me with a Trade Creditor and a Trade Debtor of equal amounts.
1365	How best do I offset these to keep my Xero accounts clean?
1366	As background info - I'm winding down a company and want to clear out the balance sheet.
1367	https://community.xero.com/business/discussion/37280114/Kinda similar to this chap..I too have only JUST started using Xero ( and this is my first kinda of accounting software as Im VERY new to this.)Ok..
1368	I've done my best to go through as much as possible on the software and Ive jumped on in and attempted to swim along.
1369	However, i THEN found out / noticed I needed to enter in starting balances etc etc to begin with and I basically didnt do this...
1370	1/ Ive basically done the following.
1371	I've imported my HSBC cvs bank statements from July  1 2014 to Jun 30th - Our Financial Year 2/ I've reconciled the statements with the sales and purchases and naturally a report has been produced...
1372	3/ Everything seemed to me seemed ok on the reports4/ My accountant has access to this now, to make life easier (which is what swung me toward using the software as I like the mobile functionality of which I KNOW i can pass on and teach to my colleagues within the business just to help streamline things on a daily basis and stay completely upto date.
1373	5/ My accountant has informed me of my balances (from my previous accounting year) though I was going on my bank statement itself 6/ So I entered them into "Conversion Balance" section but apparently still things are not right?
1374	Am I doing something wrong ?
1375	should I start again (id rather not as I've reconciled things in details, even giving descriptions on many itemsalso, my Xero Balanced don't seem to match up eitherI hope someone can help me as I really don't want to be now going back to excel as this looks like great software.
1376	Hope this makes sense!!
1377	Hi there,What information do I need to work out whether a 3rd party software will link into Xero?
1378	I am look at a lease management software, which as a feature has an accounting link allowing information to be exchanged (especially accounts payable).
1379	Regards,Patrick
1380	Trying to post payroll this afternoon, and when I went to approve the timesheets I get the error message"An error has occured. Your Payslip may be out of sync. Try again in a moment."
1381	I have been re-trying for an hour now.
1382	I have logged a support request but the response time to that is potentially 24hrs, and I would like to pay the staff today.
1383	Has anyone come across this error and a potential fix/workaround.
1384	Hello,I am looking for either a business owner or accountant who is familiar with and knows in detail the pro's and con's of how certain programs work with Xero and can offer advice on a possible solution.
1385	I am starting a new business in the UK and i want to sell both retail online and wholesale in person.
1386	I have picked Xero as my accounts package, Shopify as my online solution and i am wondering if i can run my business on just that or if i need a inventory app also.
1451	Now under my Settings -> Superannuation, I got 2 super funds that I added in.
1387	Here are the key issues: I import 100% from overseas with long lead times, so working out costings and creating purchase orders and Invoices months in advance is a question.
1388	Is Xero a good program as central data file for products?
1389	Does this info flow to shopify or do i need to duplicate data?
1390	Are the basic apps for shopify any good for linking to Ebay and Amazon?
1391	I dont have a warehouse or staff, i plan to contract out all logistics to a 3PL.
1392	I have been looking at inventory apps such as Deer, Unleashed, Trade Gecko or Cin7.
1393	Cost is a factor but it would be great to talk to someone who has used any of these with Xero and offer advice.
1394	Many ThanksNathan
1395	Right, sick of Xero payroll.
1396	Can anyone please recommend a payroll add-on that is not too expensive?
1397	Thank you
1398	For small business clients, there should be option for calculating depreciation and disposal and addition for pooled assets.
1399	Rules are quite different from normal diminishing value method hence we have to prepare manual work-paper to calculate depreciation and have to post it manually
1400	Xero Payroll does not calculate wages based on the employees start date.
1401	If your employee starts halfway through a pay run/ pay period, a manual adjustment of their hours and tax will need to be done.
1402	For example:
1403	1. We use a monthy pay cycle that ends 28th of each month
1404	2. We have setup a new employee, set the start date as 5th November 2012
1405	3. We have setup employee with annual salary, based of 40 hours work week.
1406	4. When we do a pay run, xero calculates the employee worked 23 days worth of hours, instead of 18.
1407	It has thus NOT taken into account their start date, but used the entire month.
1408	I can work around the problem by adjusting the number of hours after doing a pay run, but this is clearly undesirable and error prone (especially as wage costs are a large part of our business and getting these wrong is costly)
1409	Hi I have a case of new fixed asset, where 03 payments were made on different dates to buy the same item.
1410	01- Downpayment - paid thru Debit Card on 1st of May
1411	02- 1st partial payment - paid thru Credit Card on 15th of May
1412	03- Final payment - paid thru EFT on 20th of May
1413	Under fixed assets these three transactions are appearing as 03 different assets.
1414	How do I combine them into 01 Asset.
1415	Appreciate any reference or solution.
1416	Regards
1417	Hi.
1418	I'm switching my bank account to The Co-operative Bank UK and I see there's a feed available for (Personal Banking) which I need.
1419	Every time I try to set up the feed, Xero tells me that the access to my online banking is locked.
1420	On contacting The Co-operative Bank they tell me they have updated their online banking system so that the questions that Xero asks will no longer be acceptable.
1421	Could you look into this please as I really need to set this feed up as soon as possible?
1422	It seems the questions you need to ask are different and I do know the answers!
1423	Many thanks.
1424	Hey Guys,I recently added some funds into my business account as my cash flow was running low and then within a few weeks, transfered the same amount back to my personal account.
1425	How do I account for this on Xero as the transaction appear on the  bank feeds.
1426	Thanks,Ket
1427	I used some convenience checks from a credit card to pay some vendors.
1428	Xero excludes ALL credit card transactions and PayPal transactions.
1429	After some research, it appears as though these transactions do no meet the definition of "purchase card transaction" and as such would not be reported by the PSE (Payment Settlement Entity i.e. the credit card company) on a form 1099-K.
1430	Seems like Xero needs to add a check box somewhere that would allow these transactions to flow into the 1099 query report.http://www.marcumllp.com/blog-tax-and-business/new-form-1099-k-filing-requirement-for-merchant-card-and-third-party-network-payments
1431	This link is about federal agencies, but Q-32 I think still applies and explains it: https://www.irs.gov/Government-Entities/Federal,-State-&-Local-Governments/Federal-Agency-Frequently-Asked-Questions
1432	Any ideas on a work around until Xero fixes this?
1433	Or am I wrong?
1434	Hi there,Lets say I want to record the costs of a meal with a potential client.
1435	How would I go about it?
1436	With the flat chart of accounts, I cant create a food sub account to the biz Dev account.
1437	Is this when tracker would come in handy?
1438	Thanks,Duncan
1439	Hi I have only been using xero for a few months and have just noticed that on our profit an loss statement the wages figures are showing up twice once as a net figure and once as a gross figure and therefore throwing out our monthly figures
1440	Am I reconciling the wages wrong or how do i fix this?
1441	Meaghan
1442	I am coming from Quickbooks and I am setting up my chart of accounts.
1443	I am not familiar with setting a tax rate for each account.
1444	For example, I have a computer sales account I need to add to record our computer sales in.
1445	With Quickbooks I  normally would just set sales tax (7%) per invoice or per item I was selling and the item would be tied to the correct sales account.
1446	Do I need to set a tax rate on the actual account if I set tax rate for the item or can I just leave it at zero?
1447	I have a problem with the super setup.
1448	It is the first time I try to set this up.
1449	I have signed up with ClickSuper.
1450	Question 1.
1452	Namely ANZ and HOSTPLUS.
1453	I want to use HOSTPLUS as default and only super fund, and remove the ANZ one, but the ANZ line has a little LOCK icon there and I cannot delete it.
1454	Question 2.
1455	Does Xero/ClickSuper automatically draw funds from my bank account to pay the funds for me?
1456	If Not Should I go to HOSTPLUS to do this manually?
1457	Question 3.
1458	Some of the guys in company are long-term contractors, so they are not in �Employees� list in Xero, in this case, how do I handle super for them in the system?
1459	Looking forward to your answers and thanks very much.
1460	When a supplier requires a deposit up front with the balance to be paid on delivery, how can duplicate fixed assets in Xero be avoided?
1461	We recently ordered custom computer equipment and paid a deposit upon ordering.
1462	This transaction created a new fixed asset in Xero that I have since registered.
1463	We've now paid the balance owing and this 2nd transaction has created a duplicate fixed asset record.
1464	I will probably delete the new fixed asset but would like to be able to have both the deposit and balance payment transactions linked to the asset record.
1465	Is this possible in Xero?
1466	We have set our default to be Tax Inclusive on our sales invoices but see when we start a new invoice it reverts to Tax Exclusive.
1467	Do you have a fix for this as I can't see anything that we could be doing wrong here, as when I go back to check the setting it Tax Inclusive is definitely selected and saved.
1468	Thanks
1469	Hi There,I'm currently researching new accounting platforms for my company and wanted to check in with you Xero users as to the feasibility of Xero for our use case.
1470	The company I work for is a manufacturing company with about 75 employees (about 25 office staff and 50 factory workers).
1471	Our revenue is about $10 million per year, but our accounting practice isn't very different from a small business.
1472	PO's from customers, send invoices, pay bills.
1473	Nothing too crazy.
1474	My main concern is with transaction limits and scalability.
1475	We process about 460 invoices per month across about 140 customers (total customers in our database are about 500 to 600).We sell about 200pcs per month across 850 sku's.
1476	We process about 110 checks per month to 40 vendors or so.
1477	I'm going to follow up with Sales/Support, but I wanted see if I could get some input from actual users.
1478	Thanks for any info you can provide!

1487	I understand what tracking is.
1488	I have a company that has several locations.
1489	Can I export all my accounts put a track on them and then import them back into Xero or should I just wait till 01/07/17 and start from there.
1490	Could you please put the name of the contact on statements.
1491	Right now it has company and address only.
1492	I would like to see the contacts name.

1494	Is it just me being a Xero novice or is there a way to show a VAT summary table consisting of TaxCode, NetGoodsAmount and TaxTotal on a custom invoice using just the default currency.
1495	It seems that Xero will do exactly what I want using the Currency Conversion table but only when the invoice is in a foreign currency.
1496	I would like to have a very similar table on invoices using just the default currency.
1497	Is this the Achilles heel of Xero?
1498	In my previous accounting package (that will remain nameless) I had a VAT summary table on all my invoices (It was impossible to get rid of it!).
1499	Nearly every invoice I look at from my suppliers shows the VAT rate, the net total amount it applies to and the corresponding tax total in a table.
1500	So what am I doing wrong that means all I can show in Xero is the Tax Code and its Tax Total?
1501	I know legally it might not be essential but it's almost a courtesy to whomever has to handle the paperwork.
1502	I have asked Xero support but as yet had no reply.
1503	Is there anyone in the Xero community that can put me straight, please?
1504	I've been on this for three days solid and although I now have improved greatly my understanding of Word am no closer to achieving the invoice template I would like.
1505	Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.
1506	Thank you in advance for your time!

1511	For bank accounts that are not connected to a bank feed, it would be nice to be able to go to the account transaction page and select each transaction and like you do with remove & redo, have a reconcile option.
1512	This eliminates the need to go into each transaction manually to reconcile.
1513	Change 'amounts are in...' to 'no tax', and then then either 'tax inclusive', or 'tax exclusive' -- VAT doesn't get updated any more.

1515	Hi,I ran our first pay run last Friday and although we have claimed the Employment Allowance, the charge we would have incurred is showing on the P&L.
1516	It has definitely worked and on the RTI details, it shows the charge being deducted via the EA, however the charge is there....
1517	Am I losing my mind?
1518	Thanks in advance,Caroline
1519	Hi there,I'm still learning xero and accounting so bear with me!
1520	Through this tax year we've accidentally been using owner funds introduced + owner drawings + directors loan account to record personal money in and out.
1521	We're a ltd company, so I want to use just the director's loan account and therefore need to consolidate owners funds introduced and owner drawings into the DLA.
1522	I suppose I could go into each of the transactions (mostly expense claims) undo the payments and recode them to the DLA, but this would take some time and every adjustment (i would assume) will appear on our latest VAT return.
1523	Is it possible / advised to just make lump sum transfers from the 2 owners accounts into the DLA?
1524	This would tidy everything up, but i'm not sure how i would do this and whether there are any disadvantages to doing so
1525	Many thanks!

1527	I have a large fixed asset register, and 9 months into the tax year it is not feasible to rollback depreciation to the beginning of the year just so that I can dispose of an asset without incurring depreciation in the current year.
1528	There have been other disposals and journals created during the course of the year, and repeating the disposal of these assets is not an option.
1529	This was not a problem prior to the November 2015 improvements.
1530	I have endeavoured to set a zero depreciation rate, which the system will not accept, and also to reset the asset to having no depreciation, which the system will not allow me to do.
1531	I am inclined to think that a fix needs to be created.
1532	Does anyone have a solution.
1533	I've purchased some whitegoods on a store credit card and I'm not sure how to manage the payments.
1534	When I do a bpay to my card, what do I code the payment as?
1535	The help file recommends to code it as an equity account (such as owner funds introduced).
1536	If I do that, how to I account for the assets?
1537	Thanks for any assistance.
1538	Matt.
1539	Hi, new to payroll,Have completed my first run and have posted it.
1540	I can't now understand if I have to pay the employees from my business bank account or what I have done has generated a payment to them.
1541	It seem unclear.
1542	When I look on line it talks about clicking on employee batch payment tab to generate a payment but I do not have that anywhere so left feeling very confused.
1543	Pay is due tomorrow, do I pay manually or not?
1544	Prompt help would be appreciated.
1545	Hi, My client runs a business in the clothing industry supplying clothing to schools, clubs and businesses.
1546	I have set up 2 tracking categories, Size and Colour,  to allow him to use these specifically for invoicing customers.
1547	This is a great feature as he can make an appropriate selection on screen while invoicing.
1548	My client wants the tracking category of Size and Colour to appear the invoice to his customers.
1549	It would appear the tracking category field names are not available to customise the invoice or, I just haven't found them.
1550	Can you please provide some feedback about the tracking category field and whether I can incorporate same in to customising invoice?
1551	My client will not be using tracking categories for reporting purposes, only to invoice.
1552	Should the feature not be available to include in customising invoices, then how soon before this can be available?
1553	Thank you & regards, Robert
1554	HI , how do i input opening balances for my customers without importing them ?

1556	Multiple payments (2) were made to a supplier for a number of products (3) received, because a 'difference' payment had to be made a few days later (but before I was invoiced) to account for a change to a superior product.
1557	These 2 payments are showing up as separate lines in my company credit card account ready for reconciliation.
1558	Using the three separate invoices (that correctly show the 3 products I received) from the supplier I created a transaction (made up of the 3 items) which totalled the same 'spent' value as the 2 credit card account statement lines, however there is no option to 'split' this transaction like there is with invoice payments that I can see?!
1559	Therefore when I choose 'match' against either of the statement lines, I can see the transaction, but cannot proceed.
1560	Please advise if this requires the implementation of additional functionality or if I should undertake this reconciliation using a different process?
1561	Many Thanks / Dan
1562	Hi,We are evaluating new accounting systems and I have a requirement that does not seem to be available in entry level/mid-market systems.
1563	1. Budgets and actuals
1564	2. Time sheets
1565	3. Travel and expense reportingWe need budgets and actual cost tracking for a software company, (what Oracle would call Projects)For example let's say that we have  the following items  100:  Software Module 1 (project 1_120:  Feature x (project 2)200:  Project 3etc.
1566	Let's say we have 25 developersLoaded costs could vary for each let's say $120 to $300 per hourThe managers define a project and let's say they budget $50,000 for a project (e.g. Project 31)We'd like the team to enter their time and associate it with a budget item number (100, 120, 200) etc.
1567	I'd like to know how much we are spending on each project and how well are we planning/executing.
1568	We want to go to a cloud based system.
1569	Thanks
1570	Hi there, I have a staff member employed as a casual that is not entitled to superannuation payments (I have checked the award legislation), but Xero won't let me process her pay runs without adding a super line.
1959	Eric Whitchurch
1571	Also, even though she is registered as a casual under 'taxes' it still requires a super line.
1572	Are there settings to eliminate this line so that I can still process pays?
1573	Much appreciated!
1574	Morning,I need some advice on how to correctly input vehicle registrations.
1575	I have just noticed that I have inputted my vehicle registration details incorrectly.
1576	EG 6 months rego is $451.60so xero is calculating the GST of $41.05However the GST component is only calculated on Insurance so the correct amount of GST is $17.32
1577	Advice is greatly appreciated thank you
1578	Hi,I am new to Xero and accounting in general.
1579	I have started a used car sales business (in Scotland, UK).
1580	When buying a car to fix up and sell, is this a direct expense or should it be put in cost of goods sold?
1581	Also and repair costs, MOT, bodywork and work outsourced (paintwork, mechanics etc) for said car is this a direct expense or a cost of goods sold?
1582	Finally, each car is advertised individually, as its part of the cost of selling said car is this a direct expense of cost of goods sold?
1583	Or should it be put in the advertising account?
1584	Any help would be gratefully receivedMany thanksEric
1585	I'm looking for a time tracking tool (mainly to use for consulting work) that works well with Xero.
1586	Has anyone used either Work Flow Max or Harvest?
1587	I have one organisation in Xero, which gives three partners (and our accountant) different levels of access.
1588	I have been asked to take on another organisation, with different partners but the same Accountant.
1589	I know I can add another organisation to Xero (saving money in doing so) and restrict user access o different activity levels within that organisation.
1590	However, can I restrict each business's user access, so that users from "Business A" cannot view "Company B"s affairs (and vice versa), while the accountant and I can access both, via two log-ins or whatever?
1591	Apologies if this has already been answered, I did look and checked the closed thread, but couldn't find what I was looking for in existing threads.
1592	If one already exists, please link me to directly, it so I don't waste anyone's time.
1593	Many thanksAdrian
1594	I am relatively new to Xero and running a small business.
1595	I set up my Sales Invoice but It took a few weeks to set up my Bank Account.
1596	I now have a bank account and entered the details into Xero.
1597	I want the details to automatically appear on my Invoices so people can pay me by direct transfer.
1598	I have tried to work it out via the Sales Invoice settings but it seems you can do everything other than check a tick box to display the bank details.
1599	How do i do it?
1600	My business allows patients to pre-purchase rehab consultations in bulk, at a discount.
1601	We invoice for each of the treatment sessions, and then allocate the invoice to the pre payment.
1602	But I would like to run a report that shows me all of the prepayments currently outstanding for all patients.
1603	The only way I can see at the moment, is to run the Aged Payables report, and check each invoice individually.
1604	I'm sure there must be a better way?
1605	Can I filter the Aged Payables somehow to show me just the unallocated Prepayments?

1608	Can anyone recommend a good point of sale system for a Bar/Restaurant that integrates with Xero?
1609	We have implemented Vend for retail clients but it is missing some functionality needed for a restaurant such as table layouts.
1610	Vend themselves even state that it is not really suitable for a bar/restaurant.
1611	I have been trying Epos Now which looks good but they are based in the UK and I am concerned at their very sparse documentation on how to use the system.
1612	Any advice or examples of what bars and restaurants that use Xero are using for their POS would be greatly appreciated.

1617	Ive had a search for this and there are three treads which seem to discuss a similar thing, however each are missing one key fact.
1618	Firstly the background.
1619	We use Workflow Max to generate an invoice and that automatically gets fed into Xero as a draft.
1620	All ok from here.
1621	Then we adjust in Xero where appropriate if needed and then send the invoice as an email WITHIN Xero using the following options selected (not sure if that has anything to so with this issue, but giving the full workflow):Include files as attachments YESInclude PDF attachment YESSend me a copy (accounts@***.co.uk) YESThis goes off to the client and I receive my copy into my outlook inbox, so the invoice has definitely been sent.
1622	HOWEVER, and this is where it gets odd.
1623	When I look down my list of invoices sent out in the "Invoices Awaiting Payment" page it clearly shows that the most recent invoices not as being sent, I.E. the word "Sent" in green is not showing besides it in the list.
1624	If I select the invoice and select it's history it clearly shows three things (for example):Created17 Nov 2015 11:07 a.m. System GeneratedReceived through the Xero API from WorkflowMax Invoice sent 17 Nov 2015 11:30 a.m. Shake AccountsThis invoice has been sent to David@***.co.ukApproved17 Nov 2015 11:31 a.m. Shake Accounts INV6212 to **** Ltd for &#163;99.99.
1625	So everything is showing that it appeared in Xero from Workflow Max, was sent via email within Xero and then was approved by me.
1626	Surely if it goes through the process of sending the invoice, it should mark it as sent as everything apart from the initial import is done within Xero.
1627	(We do generate invoices directly within Xero too and we get the same issue).
1628	I must stress, this never affects clients paying, they always receive the invoices, so that is not the issue, the problem is the invoices are simply not showing as sent in searches.
1629	Any help greatly appreciated.
1630	New to Xero.
1631	Trying to setup basic COGS accounts in the chart of accounts - ie. Opening Stock, Purchases, Closing Stock.
1632	Just wish to code all purchases to Purchases, and do a simple journal monthly to record current stocks and produce P&L report with gross profit showing.
1633	Cannot see how to do this in Xero.
1634	It is simple in MYOB chart of accounts.
1635	I've googled all day and cannot find an answer.
1636	Can anyone help please?
1637	Hey, I'd love some help, when I click on the green arrow to repeat the amount I have added in Budget Manager, it changes what it does each time.
1638	Sometimes it works, however most of the time, it deletes the amount I have put in and starts with the amount I've told it to increase by?

1643	I currently use Harvest for all my invoicing and link it with Xero to reconcile transactions and prepare BAS.
1644	I have noticed on Harvest that when I set up a new invoice it has the following message "Apply Tax From Xero".
1645	After starting to put the BAS together today, it looks like Xero is saying that these invoices are BAS excluded.
1646	How do I change this?
1647	I can't seem to find settings in either Xero or Harvest.
1648	It affects reconciliation when Xero picks up a related payment from Harvest (Match) rather than when I create (and can ensure it is included in BAS)
1649	Many thanks
1650	Hi XeroI have two Xero accounts for different entities, Global Search works for one but not the other.

1654	I am wondering if anybody here has good suggestions on software we can use for tax returns.
1655	I was hoping to use Turbotax because it has great review and looks complete and very user friendly but apparently, it only integrates with Quickbooks.

1657	Hi! I am currently customising a docx invoice template.
1658	I would like the invoice to display two extra lines showing "Invoice Total" and "Less Payments Received" if payment has already been made prior to generating the invoice.
1659	Or if payment has not been made, I would like it to just display the invoice total.
1660	I have gotten this far with the first extra line using the following IF function:
1661	questions_sentences.append({ IF &#171;StatementType&#187; > 0 "Invoice Total" "" backslash* MERGEFORMAT })questions_sentences.append({ IF questions_sentences.append({ MERGEFIELD InvoiceTotalNetPayments backslash* MERGEFORMAT }) > 0 questions_sentences.append({ MERGEFIELD  InvoiceTotal backslash# "#,##0.00;(#,##0.00)" backslash* MERGEFORMAT }) backslash* MERGEFORMAT })
1662	(Note: I've used the actual backslash symbol - not just written backslash! - however I was not able to type that symbol in this post...)
1663	The "Invoice Total" label seems to display correctly according to whether or not payment has been made (first IF function), but the amount of the invoice (second IF function) displays this error message:Error! Unknown op code for conditional.
1664	> 0 and then the invoice amount shows correctly.
1665	Can anyone help?
1666	I feel like I just have a small typo that is preventing me from getting the correct formula.
1667	I've spent a long time searching help but no luck.
1668	Thanks in advance!
1669	Hi there,I was wondering if anyone can help.
1670	I have allocated 2 credit notes to one invoice for one of our clients and I'd like to keep those credit notes as 2 separate lines with corresponding amounts when I print the invoice as PDF.
1671	At the moment Xero creates one line, a sum, out of those two credit notes.
1672	Many thanks,Nicholas
1673	Hi I am new to xero, I am having trouble when raising invoices.
1674	When I raise the invoice and save it is not automatically emailing my customer.
1675	I am having to then go back into the invoice to manually send the invoice.
1676	I am worried that the reoccuring invoices may not send in the future.
1677	Thank youChris
1678	I shared a networking lunch with other business owners and we spilt the bill.
1679	I paid cash for my part and only have a copy of the invoice for the entire group.
1680	I can reconcile my part payment against the invoice then am left with an outstanding amount still showed as owing.
1681	however that amount was paid by the other people.
1682	How do i remove this amount from Xero?
1683	Should i edit the invoice amount OR use some form of credit note?
1684	However, if I do the latter then it will still show up in my accounting records

1686	Hi everyone, When I process a batch payment, the details field automatically updates to a default detail from a previous payment, or the first payment ever used to that payee.
1687	Does anyone know how to stop this from happening and for it to automatically copy the description entered in the transaction narration?

1692	I have a Stripe account and it is linked with Xero - when a client tries to pay via stripe they get an error message.
1693	I tried to pay a $1 account myself and got a message also.
1694	Not sure why this is?

1698	Hi all,New to Xero and seem to be having issues with importing pay run ABA files into our Westpac account.
1699	I have checked that the correct BSB and Account number have been entered i.e. no spaces or hyphens.
1700	I have also ticked the "Include self-balancing transaction in the ABA file" option and have included the "DE User ID" in the ABA file.
1701	When I import the file into my Westpac account, I receive the following errors:Error -- An invalid Payment From account was used. Record Number 2 Invalid debit BSB format -- please check. Record Number 3 Record type must be 1The odd thing is that the BSB is correct and the record number does start with 1.
1702	Xero support recommended I contact the bank and after 2.5 hours of troubleshooting with Westpac, they said I need to go back to Xero...
1703	Are there any other Xero/Westpac users that have successfully imported an ABA file for their pay run?
1704	Cheers,Shaun
1705	I am setting up a new partnership.
1706	There were several expenses prior to partnership opening their checking account.
1707	How would I record these in xero?
1708	I tried adding as expense receipt but then it wanted to reimburse me the bookkeeper.
1709	I was filing my sales taxes and noticed that the sales tax summary report produced different numbers than the the sales tax transactions report for the exact same period.
1710	Is there a reason why this would be happening.
1711	After an hour of investigation, I can't seem to find the reason behind this.
1712	I ended up using the sales tax transactions numbers for filing, as well as the total sales numbers pulled from the profit and loss report.
1713	Hello Can anyone help me please as I have a tricky problem?
1714	The situation is staff are salaried (annual amount/hours = hourly rate) however they are paid monthly in arrears (last day of the month) for the actual number of days worked and not simply Annual salary / 12 months.
1715	The issue is their leave needs to be calculated monthly Based on Ordinary Earnings for the month and not just 152 hours / 12 months.
1716	When I try and put this into Xero AU Payroll it tells I have to insert a monthly amount of leave calculated.
1717	This is clearly different between months January and February as an example.
1718	Any suggestions please?

1720	Hi,I sent this question into support a week ago, and still have not gotten a response.
1721	I hope someone here can help me!
1722	My accountant set up my bank feeds for me.
1723	One of them is the situation where only the person who set up the feed can refresh it.
1724	This bank feed fails all the time, and every time, like a pest, I have to email my accountant to refresh the feed for me.
1725	Both my accountant and I would prefer it if I could refresh the feed.
1726	I understand that only the one who added the feed can refresh it - how can I be that person instead of my accountant?
1727	If I am the only one who can refresh it, that is perfectly fine.
1728	It's just a hassle when SHE is the only one who can refresh it.
1729	So is there any way to switch that over?
1730	I've tried looking around in Xero to figure out if I can re-enter the bank feed info so that then I will be the special *person* with the permissions, but I haven't been able to find any way to do that.
1731	Suggestions?
1732	Thanks so much,Heather
1733	I am looking for a SAS provider to compliment Xero.
1734	Is anyone out there using such a service that they can recommend - I have heard of Huddle, Basecamp...
1735	We would love to find fellow Xero users in our supply chain and would even consider changing certain suppliers to Xero users for ease of use.
1736	Trouble is there is not a subtle way of finding out who uses Xero.
1737	I thought there was a Xero user directory but can't find one.
1738	I have a client who operates his payroll for two shops.
1739	It would be a good feature to be able to show the address of the location the employee works on the payslip rather than a single location for all.
1740	It's very common to invoice 50% of an invoice first and then on final invoice there's the next 50% and possibly additional expenses.
1741	PLEASE XERO can you add this feature whereby I can deduct an amount already received/invoiced?
1742	It would help a lot!
1743	Instead I have to manually create another invoice to do this which completely defeats the purpose of having XERO in the first place.
1744	Hi everyone.
1745	I have been using Xero for my own small company for 2 years and its fantastic.
1746	However one of my clients with 120 staff but an uncomplicated Architectural Business are concerned its too small for them.
1747	Any thoughts, as I say its not a complicated business, no discounts, no inventory etc etc.
1748	your thoughts would be appreciatedJoe
1749	Who's the genius who thought the least important thing on a payslip was the payee's name?
1750	Why on earth make that section in a smaller print than the majority of the document?
1751	I have just completed my first financial year, and am confused about how to account for Corporation Tax in Xero.
1752	I have submitted my tax return and just paid the tax due to HMRC.
1753	I have reconciled the bank transaction so that now I have an Expense sitting against account 500 - Corporation Tax.
1754	In my Profit and Loss for 2016-17, the expense against code 500 is now shown as an operating expense and reduces down the net profit for the year.
1755	Is there any way of separately showing net profit BEFORE tax (and having the Corporation Tax expense sitting between net profit BEFORE tax and net profit AFTER tax?).
1756	Thanks,Ben
1757	I have completed all of the payroll enrolment details in Payroll settings but Xero is not selecting any staff to be included in auto enrolment.
1758	All of them are eligible by my reckoning but none are selected.
1759	On the Employee tab under Eligibility Status the box is greyed out.
1760	I am clearly missing something but after assessing this forum and the videos I am no clearer what I am missing.
1761	Could somebody suggest what I am missing.
1762	ThanksAndy
1763	Hi all.Im a new Xero user and trying to create my first invoice.
1764	All good except the invoice isn't showing my bank account details so I can get paid by EFT.
1765	How can this be added to the standard template?
1766	I have entered the details into the financial section.
1767	I have searched the boards here for an answer and can't seem to find one.
1768	Thanks!
1769	HI I have been using xero for 6 months and on the whole it is fantastic.
1770	One thing that i would like to see is the credit invoices issued by suppliers to be able to be manually ticked against a payment rather than allocating it to another invoice.
1771	As a lot of our credit notes do not correspond with invoices from the supplier and it then becomes difficult for suppliers to match off our invoices from our remittances.
1772	Also the fact that each time you load an invoice onto a supplier that has a credit note, a reminder comes up that there is a credit note available,
1773	this in turn seems to stop the flow of creating another bill, as it takes you to that invoice if you dont allocate this credit.
1774	Looking forward to your reply
1775	i just added new expense account, in the drop down list on Expense claim>Current Claim›New Receipt>account

1790	I am struggling to sort out the best way to handle reconciling two transactions I have in Xero.
1791	I have two separate vendors who issued partial refunds after a purchase was made.
1792	One was because we were charged too much for shipping and the other because we were charged for an upgrade that we did not end up using.
1793	Both of the original expenses were one off expenses paid via credit card and do not have associated bills.
1794	They were just reconciled along with other bank transactions.
1795	How do I handle the refunds?
1796	They don't seem to be overpayments, and I don't have a bill to create a credit note against.
1797	I could create bills but is that a best practice?
1798	If I just choose to reconcile it and label is as "vendor refund" is it categorized as an asset or as revenue?
1799	Any guidance would be very much appreciated. Thanks!
1800	Hi there — I am starting a business that is pretty straightforward wholesale distribution.
1801	Payments will mostly come in via check, but many customers will pay via credit card.
1802	I love the idea of being able to email an invoice to a customer with a big PAY NOW button, which will let them simply input their CC details secureley and pay their invoice.
1803	This is a new venture for me, though, and I'm admittedly ignorant on the details and variables I should be considering when making this.
1804	Which service should I integrate?
1805	How do the services that integrate with Xero compare to setting up Merchant Services through my bank?
1806	Would appreciate any guidance regarding how I might go about thinking about this problem and coming up with a good solution."),
1807	Hi there,We use Capital On Tap as a regular loans service.
1808	There is no option for bank feeds and the loan is paid in as and when we require it (almost like a transfer from a separate account with a loan limit).
1809	We then have to pay back a minimum amount every month depending on the cumulative total we have loaned at the end of that month so the amount is never fixed, always variable.
1810	I ideally want to record the capital we have received (ad hoc), the amount we have paid back (monthly) and the interest as an expense.
1811	The loan was started before we began using Xero so I realise I will need to enter a conversion balance.
1812	But I was wondering if anyone had any idea on how to go about recording the payments in, the repayments out and the interest.
1813	Would I need to create two accounts, one for loan and one for loan interest?
1814	I hope this makes sense and thanks in advance for any help or light you can shed on this.
1815	Many thanks,Joe
1816	I'm just starting to reconcile after adding Kounta integration, and am not sure how to handle cash purchases made from the cash register.
1817	If a supplier is paid cash on delivery from the till, the deducted cash is recorded as "cash out" showing the reduced cash in the till.
1818	How do I record this invoice paid by cash in Xero?
1819	The Kounta integration only shows the reduced cash in "cash register clearing account", not the COGS account.
1820	When you receive a purchase order in Kounta it doesn't appear to allow you to specify how the invoice was paid.
1821	Thanks,Christie
1822	I have been using Xero for a couple of years and absolutely love it.
1823	However I have a major problem today in that one of my clients is now registered for the Flat Rate Scheme at 12%.
1824	When I generate the VAT Return every box is coming up 0.00.
1825	Can anyone help ?
1826	I am currently looking for a quicker and more accurate way to report my super contributions.
1827	We currently use CBUS clearing account however the CSV file they require every month is not downloadable from Xero.
1828	Does anyone else upload a file direct from Xero to a clearing house?
1829	I tried to use the auto option in Xero through Click Super but as I need receipts to send to customers and neither Click or Xero can offer any reporting this is a dead end.
1830	Any suggestions?
1831	We currently use Xero and are now in the process of finding a suitable POS and Stock control system.
1832	Ideally the POS system we would like touch screen based suitable for staff with limited computer skills or even iPad as we    could operate with more than one sales counter Our stock is varied from standard hardware / building lines  through to Animal health and stock feed,so we need to be able to sell in the same item in different formats. bulk and per metre / or per KG  or single units.We do run monthly accounts for customers as well.
1833	we previously tried myob retail manager - and it failed as it was far to complex
1834	"HiWe have some suppliers who have up to 70 invoices required for paymentTo avoid having to enter these all individually we create one purchase for the supplier,
1835	and in the body of the purchase, enter all the invoices. Of course we are unable to list every invoice number in the reference box, so we call it by the month of statement.
1836	It makes it very easy then to identity, pick up & batch all bills that need to be paid at the end of the month, as they all have the same reference.
1837	This works fine for us, but we do get requests from our suppliers as to what invoices we are paying, as the remittance only says 'April 17 Statement'.
1838	Is there anyway to send a remittance with the body of the purchase showing?
1839	Are we purchasing incorrectly?
1840	Thanks
1841	Hi,I run a staff temping agency and hire out my staff to other businesses.
1842	Is there a Xero connected app that allows the clients to approve time-sheets online?
1843	Thanks
1844	Hi, I was asked to run an aged receivables report for 90 days and older (retentions of 5-10%)
1845	but when I did there were invoices showing up as outstanding but when you drill into them it's been paid and the outstanding amount is $0
1846	Has anyone had this issue before?
1847	"I have been advised by our accountant to put through a number of invoices from a client as a 'bad debt'.
1848	I followed the forum posts and set up the account code and put through as credit notes but I'm told this isn't what they want.
1849	Is it possible to put through a bad debt differently, such a journal entry, on an accrual scheme so that we can claim the VAT back but stillleave the invoices open in case we do eventually get payments in?
1850	We want to still be able to send statements etc, if requested, but adding a credit note to the invoices means that we are not able to do this as they're down as 'paid',
1851	"Hi thereWe don't raise Xero invoices for our occasional suppliers, instead we'll simply create the transactions at reconciliation time,adding a new contact as necessary.
1852	My question is -  what's the easiest way to search for these transactions by contact name?
1853	I had a case this morning where I needed to quickly add a file to a historical transaction for a known contact and I had to do the following:- Start at the dashboard.- Click on Accounts -> Bank Accounts- Click the correct bank account.- Click the 'Transactions' tab.- Click 'Search', enter the contact name.Click the appropriate transaction from the list that appears.
1854	That's quite laborious and also involves knowing which bank account the transaction belongs to.
1855	What am I missing here?
1856	I tried, instead, to do it via the 'Contacts' page, searched and found the correct contact, but there didn't seem to be a link to click through and view alltransactions associated with that contact.
1857	Frustratingly, I could see a bar graph, visualising the transaction amounts, but no obvious way to view them.
1858	Hi,This is a more general question about physical inventory management and not necessarily related to Xerobut I figure that this is probably a good place to ask as I can't be the only person selling physical products
1859	My business is wholesale alcohol business and we have to do regular inventory counts in our multiple warehouses.
1860	At the moment this is done manually on paper and then transferred to excel.
1861	I would like to move to a more automated system where the person doing the inventory count scans a product barcode and types in the number of items in the warehouse.
1960	Hi,I would like to know if there is a way to force expire the token?
1862	If this can be achieved with a barcode scanner that links wirelessly to an app on a tablet or phone it would be great.
1863	I've been trying to find suitable products to do this but haven't yet found the right solution.
1864	How do other people handle this?
1865	Are there any hardware / software solutions out there that you would recommend?
1866	Thanks!Harold
1867	Hi,The Australian Payroll API was recently updated to include USI (unique superannuation identifier).
1868	I have an external system I connect to Xero that tries to match a super fund based on SPIN/USI, and I cannot search by USI via the API. 
1869	When I to find a Super Fund via the API by querying on the new USI field, and it keeps returning an error "USI property is not supported for Where or Order clause".
1870	I can query by other fields e.g. SPIN Example query: /payroll.xro/1.0/SuperFunds?Where=USI%3D%3D%22TLS0100AU%22 
1871	API exception returned: USI property is not supported for Where or Order clause
1872	Can anyone help?
1873	I am getting reports from users of an error "Account could not be found" when sending their sales to Xero via the API.
1874	It appears that the accounts they are sending to exist, is there anything else that can cause this error?
1875	Hey!We are looking for a highly experianced developer who has is well versed in Ruby On Rails to intergrate veeqo.com with Xero.
1876	 So that Veeqo.com clients can export their sales invoices/purchase orders/COGS to Xero.
1877	 Preferably someone who has experience of doing something similar would be great.
1878	Hi,How do I  set the Branding theme when creating a new invoice using BrandingThemeId?
1879	 How do I find the GUID that is related to the theme I want to use?
1880	Hi Guys, I just noticed something that might been little strange or also might be by design.
1881	when creating an invoice i include the contact record details (no guid) full details, this normally either creates a new contact or finds and existing one.
1882	during testing i noticed that one of the contact matched even thou the company name was different.
1883	it then updated the contact and changed the company name.  Edited \t26 Jun 2014 3:20 p.m. \tSystem Generated \tName changed from 'OLD COMPANY' to 'NEW COMPANY'.
1884	personally would have expected the new company to be created not some existing company updated.
1885	Can you please let me rules that are used for matching contacts as for some of the records i am processing i might have to create a contact in a separate call and pass in the guid instead.
1886	particularly if a customer has multiple businesses operating from the same location.
1887	ThanksPaul

1892	Hi there,At the moment we use the demo environment.
1893	However have three problems with it.
1894	One of them is that it does not contain our production data and the second one is that it expires after 30 days.
1895	The third problem is that it is bound to one account, which makes it harder for the developers to share one demo environment to test.
1896	Does Xero support a sandbox environment or an environment which is a copy of production?
1897	Or is it possible to keep the demo environment alive for more then 30 days, including the sharing of the demo account?
1898	Thanks and Regards,Keethanjan
1899	I'm wondering if there is any way to limit the number of results returned--for example, an equivalent to "SELECT TOP 100" in SQL.We intend to create about 800 invoices per month via the API, and all of them will be created on the same day and have the same invoice date and due date, so I don't think we could use any date fields or "if modified since" to limit the results.
1900	  When issuing a GET request on these, ideally, we'd be able to split it up into 8 different API calls; i.e.
1901	in the following pseudo code:\tRequest 1 of 8: Get the top 100 records where invoice date is 2012-04-02T00:00:00 order by UpdatedDateUTC\tRequest 2 of 8: Get the top 100 records where invoice date is 2012-04-02T00:00:00 and UpdatedDateUTC > (the last UpdatedDateUTC in Request 1) order by UpdatedDateUTC\tAnd so on, until there are no more records retrieved.\t
1902	Is there any way either to limit the records returned or some other way to split up this request into multiple API calls?

1911	I find the new .Net library extremely unintuitive and convoluted.
1912	Even looking at the example implementations it is not a quick or easy thing to tease out the best way to implement and utilise this myself.
1913	I look forward to a straightforward library with straightforward example code of how to implement it.
1914	IMHO, 9 arguments for a constructor is too many (see PartnerMvcAuthenticator in the example code).
1915	Hello, I've got problem when trying to exchange request token to access token (sending request to /oauth/AccessToken).
1916	First step was completed successfuly and I redirected myself to /APIAuthorise.aspx page, where I authorized my app to access my account.
1917	After redirecting me back to callback url I always get "oauth_problem=signature_invalid&oauth_problem_advice=Failed%20to%20validate%20signature" response from /oauth/AccessToken.
1918	Here are data I send and receive:This code is provided by the developer community - Xero does not warrant it in any wayI'm pretty sure that signature is made correctly -
1919	I use OAuthSimple class provided in one of Xero`s code samples.
1920	Full sample works correctly, the problem appears when I try to attach the library into our application.
1921	It's the newest version available.
1922	Hi,I am using the Xero API and sending a HTTP GET request from my application to Xero to return Contacts that match a certain Name.
1923	So...using instructions from http://developer.xero.com/documentation/getting-started/http-requests-and-responses/#title3, I send (for example) Name="A Company Ltd" urlencoded as part of the URL.
1924	This works fine, until I search on a Name that includes a double quote in it.
1925	Does anyone know how to get it to work and Xero to not return an error when a double quote exists?
1926	I know it's highly unlikely that a Name would have a double quote in it, but it's always best to make an application as robust as possible in my opinion, no matter how unlikely.
1927	Many thanks in advance.Cheers,Rhyd.
1928	I'm trying to return all Invoices for June 2013, NOT just those that have been changed since a certain date.
1929	I can see how the API documentation handles this situation, it says to use the following value for the where parameter (from http://developer.xero.com/api-overview/http-requests-and-responses/#get-filtered):
1930	FullyPaidOnDate >= DateTime(2011, 10, 01) AND FullyPaidOnDate <= DateTime(2011, 10, 30)
1931	However I'd like to use the useful xero.php wrapper if possible.
1932	After reading the github page and various discussions on here as well as the code, it looks to me as if the filter I should be setting is as follows (ie the 'value' of the array item is itself an array made up of operand, literal value):
1933	$aFilter = array(\t'Date' => array('>=','DateTime(2013, 06, 01)')\t,'Date' => array('<=','DateTime(2013, 06, 30)'));$result = $xero->Invoices('','',$aFilter,'');
1934	However this results in the following error:Array(    [ErrorNumber] => 16    [Type] => QueryParseException    [Message] => Operator '<=' incompatible with operand types 'DateTime?' and 'String')
1935	Also of course as the field name is the array key, I only end up with one array item not two as you can see in the array dump:
1936	Array(    [Date] => Array        (            [0] => <=            [1] => DateTime(2013,06,30)        ))
1937	Any help that you can offer would be appreciated.
1938	Dear Sirs,This question is targeted toward Xero support people and administrators.
1939	I was not able to find answer to my question, so I have to post my question here.
1940	COZYROC is the leading provider of third-party components for Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services.
1941	We have recently included adapters which support the Xero application.
1942	We would like to ask what information you need from us so you can post details about COZYROC's solution here:https://developer.xero.com/code-samples/tools/overview/
1943	Thank you for your time in advance!
1944	Hi all. I'm a newbie web developer and also new to xero api.
1945	What I am asking is simple. How to create the function for a GET/POST request for invoices?
1946	I have looked at the api previwer, understand the xml but not how to implement the "run" button function
1947	Any sample code to look at including a submit button?
1948	I have been uploading Timesheets to Xero successfully in an application in C# for over 12 months.
1949	With the latest revision of the app (no changes to the codeline used for the Timesheets upload), I am no longer able to do the uploads and am getting a BadRequest exception raised.
1950	The detail merely shows "A validation exception occurred".
1951	I have the Api.Timesheets.Create in a try/catch block, with three separate catch blocks.
1952	The first of these is:catch (Xero.Api.Infrastructure.Exception.ValidationException vE){.....}but this is not trapping.
1953	The second catch block is for BadRequestException and that traps.
1954	How can I then determine the actual Validation errors?
1955	The full ValidationException block contains::\terrStore += "Validation errors from xero:\\r\\n";\tforeach (var v in vE.ValidationErrors)\t{\t\terrStore += v.Message + "\\r\\n";\t\tAppGlobals.logger.Error("Error: TS Upload error" + v.Message + "\\r\\n");\t}
1956	but with that not being trapped how can I find the errors?
1957	Why does the BadRequest exception supersede the ValidationException, or are there multiple exceptions occurring?
1958	It makes life fairly difficult when my client cannot determine what has gone wrong without my having to get into debug mode on a production system.
1961	I want to test my application against different scenarios so it will be great if we can "induce" token expiration instead of having to wait 30 minutes for it to systematically expire.
1962	I am using a public application and official PHP Xero API wrapper.
1963	Thanks!
1964	Why is it that Xero will not accept an email address with numeric characters in the TLD either by API or manual Contact entry?
1965	There are TLDs which have numeric character in them listed on IANA - http://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt  (scroll down to .XN domains).
1966	(encoded as "xn--mgberp4a5d4ar") ("al-Saudiah") in Arabic Script,which is registered to the Saudi Network Information Centre
1967	I get thrown this error via API:Error: 10 ValidationException A validation exception occurred Email address must be valid. Email address must be valid.
1968	Thanks.
1969	Hi,I have a web app that requires invoicing, inventory and payroll access to insert timesheets.
1970	Have got it working using the core api Version 2 & have got hold of the payroll DotNet sample (which looks to be the same as the core api sample with a console payroll section).
1971	Anyway the example doesn't show the situation where I wan to use both api's...i.e I want to process invoices using the core api and then turn the page to payroll and insert time-sheets.
1972	Do I have to log out of 1 and log into the other?
1973	Can I use the same access token to create both payroll and core repositories?
1974	Any examples of the above in DotNet?
1975	First scenario:I am using the PUT method to create an invoice in Xero,
1976	I have an issue with the lineAmount when a CurrencyRate apply.
1977	This is one of my LineItems in my Invoice XML:LineItem\tDescription: EDGA01:INVBE3983:Travel\tLineAmount: 66.201300\tTaxAmount: 0.0000\tAccountCode: RET300\tCurrency fields as part of the Invoice XML:CurrencyCode: USDCurrencyRate: 0.0743The lineItem in the response from XERO, looked like this for the above line item:{          "Description": "EDGA01:INVBE3983:Travel",          "UnitAmount": 66.20,          "TaxType": "NONE",          "TaxAmount": 0.00,          "LineAmount": 66.20,          "AccountCode": "RET300",          "Tracking": ,          "Quantity": 1.0000,          "LineItemID": "732ca155-e1bc-4fe0-bb77-504f25540034",          "ValidationErrors": },
1978	Why does the LineAmount change to 66.20, does XERO only accepts 2 decimal points?
1979	Second scenario:I decided to send through the lineAmount with 2 decimal points.
1980	This is one of my LineItems in my Invoice XML:LineItem\tDescription: ILLI11:INVBE3985:Setup\tLineAmount: 224.25\tTaxAmount: 0.00\tAccountCode: ASC400Currency fields as part of the Invoice XML:CurrencyCode: EURCurrencyRate: 0.0690
1981	So according to my understanding Xero should do a reverse calculation for the value in the Revenue account: 224.25 % 0.0690 = R3250.00, but instead the Revenue account reports R3249.99
1982	Hi,I am trying to modify a paid invoice by changing the account_code for given line item. I can modified unpaid invoice with out a problem.
1983	However once the payment exist, I receive the error: "Invoice not of valid status for modification"Which makes sense, however I was hoping since I am able to change the item account code easily on the web UI, even if an payment has been created,    that I could do the same thing via the API.
1984	Any ideas are highly appreciated,thank youJacob
1985	Hi,We are trying to integrate Xero into our web based application for accounting .
1986	We have different versions of same product running on cloud . each client has its own url like https ://<<clientname>>.ourproduct.com.
1987	Will you please suggest what app type we should use ?
1988	Hi GuysI did a quick search for this but couldn't find an answer I was looking for. The documentation describes:  "Daily Limit: 5000 calls in a rolling 24 hour window"
1989	We have different versions of same product running on cloud . each client has its own url like https ://<<clientname>>.ourproduct.com.
1990	At what time does the count reset?
1991	Is this relative to the API token you are using and when this is created, or is it every 00:00UTC? or at some other time?
1992	I'd like to track the API calls we make to ensure we throttle properly so we never hit the limit, however thats difficult to program unless I know when the API limits are reset.
1993	Thanks,Chris

1999	With a payment that is part of a bulk payment this returns the first purchase invoice associated with the bulk payment rather than the correct purchase invoice
2000	based on the payment amount it seems like a bulk payment divides into smaller payments but the invoice does not correspond)

2002	Hi there,Firstly, apologies if this is in the wrong place.
2003	There were at least 3 possible places this question could've been created, but I figured as I'm using wrapper code it should go here.
2004	I'm using the .NET Xero API SDK 2.0.20 in C#.I'm trying to send an invoice to a customer upon payment.
2005	It should be sent with the invoice in a paid state (so there is no confusion).
2006	I've got the code down good to apply the payment to the invoice, and sending the e-mail goes fine.
2007	But then when we try to update the invoice to say it's been sent out, I get the following validation errors:* "Invoice not of valid status for modification"* "This document cannot be edited as it has a payment or credit note allocated to it."
2008	Here is some of the code I'm using. {\t// bits and bobs to get the payment made\t_privateAppApi.Payments.Create(payment);\tEmailInvoice(payment);\tUpdateXeroInvoiceSentToContact(payment.Invoice);}private void UpdateXeroInvoiceSentToContact(XeroModels.Invoice invoice){\tinvoice.SentToContact = true;\t_privateAppApi.Invoices.Update(invoice);}
2009	Any ideas of how this could/should be handled?
2010	I thought about trying to set the sent status first, then applying the payment and then sending the e-mail. The problem with this approach is that I'd get caught out again if something went wrong sending the e-mail, I wouldn't then be able to set SentToContact to false, because a payment has been applied. Which doesn't feel quite right.
2011	Any help appreciated.Cheers,Craig
2012	I am trying to work out the best way to update an existing Timesheet (Australian Payroll API), without replacing or overwriting the existing TimesheetLines.
2013	At the moment when POSTING and specifying the TimesheetID, the existing TimesheetLines are lost.
2014	Also if the Timesheet is Approved then you can no longer POST to it.
2015	Having to rePOST the entire TimesheetLines content seems odd.
2016	Suggestions very welcome.
2017	We have developed an integration between our software (a .Net Winforms application) with Xero,        allowing the user to import revenue and expense transactions using the API, into our software.
2018	At the moment, every time the user wants to execute this import from within our software, they are presented with a Xero authentication page,         where they enter in the username and password, and then on a second page, select the ‘organisation’ they want to allow our software to access    (screenshot  https://www.screencast.com/t/JCwxMns3bW8 )
2019	I see that there is an ‘Allow access for 30 mins’ option, which saves them from having to login multiple times, however it still always prompts the user during this 30min period to select the Xero organisation.
2020	Is it possible for us to capture and store their Xero username / password, and the organisation that they have originally selected, within our software, so we can programmatically use them in the future?
2021	So each time they would want to execute an import, they won’t have to login or select their organisation again. Is this possible to do with Xero?
2022	Our AffinityLive product allows users to record expenses against a project.
2023	In some cases they may not be personal expenses but ones paid for already by a business credit card or chequebook, etc.
2024	We are wondering if these expenses can be pushed through to Xero via the API.
2025	My understanding is that these are not Expense Claims assigned to a user, but are more general business expenses which are recorded differently.
2026	We're a bit lost on how to proceed - part of the problem of course is that we're not accountants and may be taking the wrong approach!
2027	Appreciate any advice.
